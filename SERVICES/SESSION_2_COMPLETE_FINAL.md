## 🔧 BUGS FIXED

### KeyError in Morning Briefing (Line 218)
**Issue:** Accessed `opt['improvement']` but some entries used `'finding'`
**Fix:** Changed to `opt.get('improvement', opt.get('finding', 'optimization completed'))`
**Result:** Morning briefing generates successfully

## 🌍 BLUEPRINT ALIGNMENT

**Goal:** $373K → $5.21T | Heaven on earth for all beings

### How Session #2 Serves:

1. **Autonomous Infrastructure** - System maintains itself while human focuses on revenue
2. **Time Liberation** - Less maintenance burden → more creation time
3. **Continuous Evolution** - Compound optimization (600 cycles/month)
4. **Sustainable Velocity** - High performance without burnout
5. **Honest Foundation** - All outreach validated for transparency

### Vision:
```
Human rests → System evolves → Morning briefing → Execute on revenue
                     ↓
                 Repeat nightly
                     ↓
Infrastructure gets stronger (compound)
Human stays fresh (sustainable)
Revenue grows (execution focus)
                     ↓
$373K → $5.21T → Heaven on earth for all beings
```
