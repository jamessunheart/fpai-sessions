# Day 0: Testing if AI can match financial advisors (zero customers)

Starting an experiment today.

**The hypothesis:** AI can understand compatibility well enough to match people with financial advisors better than Google.

**Why I'm testing this:**
- My dad's a CFP, gets terrible leads from generic services
- Clients struggle to find advisors who understand their situation
- Seems like a matching problem AI could solve

**What I built:**
- Simple form: describe your needs (RSUs, tax optimization, etc)
- AI analyzes advisor profiles for compatibility
- Free for customers, advisors pay only if engagement happens

**Current status:**
- Live: http://198.54.123.234:8401
- Customers: 0
- Feedback: 0
- Learning: None yet

**What I want to find out:**
1. Will people trust AI for something this important?
2. Can AI actually judge compatibility?
3. Is this useful or am I solving the wrong problem?

**Commitment:** Will post honest updates weekly whether this works or fails.

**Week 1 goal:** Get 5 people to try it and give real feedback.

Anyone interested in testing? Or telling me why this won't work?
