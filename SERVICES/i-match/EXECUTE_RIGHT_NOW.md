# ⚡ EXECUTE RIGHT NOW (2 Minutes → First Customer)

**NO APIs. NO Credentials. NO Setup.**
**Just copy-paste to Reddit.**

---

## Step 1: Open Reddit (30 seconds)

Go to: https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/submit

---

## Step 2: Copy This Title

```
Testing if AI can match financial advisors better than Google [Early Experiment]
```

---

## Step 3: Copy This Body

```markdown
I'm testing whether AI (Claude specifically) can match people to financial advisors better than just Googling "financial advisor near me".

**Completely honest about the experiment:**
- This is Phase 1 testing - very early
- I built an AI matching engine (Python + FastAPI)
- It analyzes compatibility: values, communication style, specialties
- If you're looking for a financial advisor AND willing to try an experimental AI matching system, you can help test this

**The deal:**
- Free for you (always)
- I make a small commission if you hire someone (standard 15-20% referral)
- You get an AI-analyzed match instead of random Google results
- I collect feedback to improve the system

**Currently testing with:**
- Financial advisors (this post)
- Later: Therapists, career coaches, tutors, trainers

If this works, it could scale to any service where "fit" matters more than price.

**Signup:** https://fullpotential.com/support (quick form)

*Note: I'm one person with ~$373K to turn into $5T over 10 years (ambitious goal). This is service #1. Built with Claude AI. Being maximally honest about the experiment because that's the only sustainable way to build.*

---

**Questions I expect:**
1. "How does AI know compatibility?" → It analyzes what you value + what advisors specialize in
2. "Why would I trust this?" → You shouldn't yet! That's why it's an experiment
3. "What if the match sucks?" → Tell me, I'll fix it. That's the point of Phase 1

Feedback welcome. Roast it, question it, or try it.
```

---

## Step 4: Click "Post"

That's it.

---

## What Happens Next (24-48 hours)

1. **10-50 comments** (expect skepticism + genuine interest)
2. **5-20 form submissions** from curious people
3. **1-3 quality leads** who actually want financial advisors
4. **Your job**: Respond honestly to comments, collect feedback

---

## If You Want To Go Further (Optional)

Post the SAME thing to r/financialindependence:
https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/submit

---

## Providers (After Customers Sign Up)

Once you have 3+ customer signups, message financial advisors on LinkedIn:

```
Hi [Name],

I'm testing an AI-powered matching system for financial advisors. Instead of clients finding you via Google, they get matched via compatibility analysis (values, communication style, specialties).

If this works, you'd get higher-quality leads (pre-matched by AI).

Phase 1 testing now. Free to try. 15-20% referral if clients hire you.

Interested in being one of the first providers? Reply or sign up: https://fullpotential.com/support

Thanks,
James

Send to 10 advisors → Expect 1-3 to respond

## Revenue Timeline

- **Week 1**: Reddit post → 5-20 customer leads
- **Week 2**: Recruit 3-5 provider advisors
- **Week 3-4**: AI matches customers to providers
- **Month 2-3**: First commissions roll in ($500-2,500)

---

## Why This Works

1. **Honest**: You're clear it's an experiment
2. **Value-first**: Free for customers
3. **Proof**: You're building in public
4. **Feedback loop**: You'll iterate based on what people say

---

## Bottom Line

**Copy title + body → Post to r/fatFIRE → Done.**

Everything else (database, matching engine, automation) is already running.

You're 2 minutes away from first customer.
