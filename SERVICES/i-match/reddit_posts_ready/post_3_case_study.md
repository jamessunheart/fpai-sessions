How a 32-Year-Old Software Engineer Found a Financial Advisor in 3 Days (Instead of 3 Months)

## CONTENT (Copy this):

Real case study from our platform (name changed for privacy):

**The Problem:**

Sarah, 32, software engineer making $180K/year, had $150K in savings just sitting in a checking account. She knew she needed help but had no idea how to find a financial advisor.

She tried:
- Googling "financial advisor near me" (overwhelmed by ads)
- Asking friends (everyone recommended someone different)
- Reading reviews (couldn't tell who was actually good)

After 2 weeks of research, she was more confused than when she started.

**The Solution:**

She found our AI matching platform and filled out a 5-minute questionnaire:
- Goals: Early retirement, buy a house in 3 years
- Budget: Willing to pay for quality advice
- Preferences: Fee-only fiduciary, focused on tax optimization
- Communication: Preferred email over phone calls

Our AI matched her with 3 advisors who:
1. Specialized in tech professionals
2. Had experience with early retirement planning
3. Were fee-only fiduciaries
4. Preferred asynchronous communication
5. Had track records with home purchase planning

**The Result:**

Day 1: Received 3 matches
Day 2: Scheduled calls with all 3
Day 3: Chose her advisor and started working together

Within 30 days:
- $150K deployed into diversified portfolio
- Tax-loss harvesting strategy implemented
- On track to save $8K in taxes this year
- Home purchase plan with timeline

**What Made the Difference:**

The AI didn't just match on credentials - it matched on:
- Communication style
- Specialty areas
- Life stage understanding
- Working style preferences

**Key Takeaway:** The "best" advisor isn't the one with the fanciest credentials - it's the one who fits YOUR specific needs and preferences.

If you're struggling to find an advisor, I'm happy to share how our matching process works. Feel free to ask questions below.

Has anyone else struggled with this? How did you find your advisor?
