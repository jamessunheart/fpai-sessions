## 🎯 REDDIT POST TEMPLATES

### r/fatFIRE Post

**Title:** "Built an AI to find your perfect financial advisor (free for customers)"

```
I got burned by a generic financial advisor who didn't understand tech compensation.

So I built an AI matching system that analyzes 100+ advisors to find the perfect fit based on:
• Your specific needs (RSUs, ISOs, tax optimization, etc.)
• Values alignment (fee-only vs commission, philosophy)
• Communication style
• Specialization

Free for customers. Advisors pay us only if you engage.

Testing with 50 people this week. Comment or DM if interested.

Edit: Wow, didn't expect this response! Sending links to everyone who commented. Please allow 24 hours for matches.
```

### r/financialindependence Post

**Title:** "Free AI matching to find financial advisor who gets FIRE"

```
Finding a financial advisor who understands FIRE is hard.

Most push expensive products or don't get the early retirement mindset.

I built an AI that matches you with advisors based on:
• FIRE specialization
• Fee-only requirement
• Tax optimization focus
• Your specific situation (income, savings rate, timeline)

Free service (advisors pay if you engage). Testing with 50 people.

Want in? Comment or DM.
