## TEMPLATE 1: VALUE_FIRST_INTRO

**When to use:** CFP certified advisors, established professionals

**Subject Line (if connection request):**
Help You Find Qualified Retirement Planning Clients?

**Message:**

```
Hi {first_name},

I noticed you specialize in {specialty} at {company}. I'm building an AI-powered platform that connects financial advisors with qualified clients who are actively looking for help.

Quick question: Are you currently accepting new clients in the {specialty_area} space?

If so, I'd love to send you 2-3 qualified leads this month at no upfront cost. You only pay a small referral fee if you decide to work with them.

Interested? Happy to send details.

Best,
James

Struggling to Find Qualified Leads?

**Message:**

```
Hi {first_name},

Quick question for you as a {job_title}:

What's your biggest challenge right now - finding qualified clients or converting the ones you have?

I ask because I built an AI matching platform that pre-qualifies clients based on their needs, budget, and goals - then connects them with advisors like you.

Would love to send you 1-2 qualified matches this month (no cost) to see if it's a fit.

Worth 15 minutes to chat?
