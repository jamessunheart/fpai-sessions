## RESPONSE TEMPLATES

When someone responds positively:

**Response 1: "Tell me more"**
```
Hi {first_name},

Happy to explain! I MATCH is an AI platform that connects financial advisors with qualified clients.

Here's how it works:
1. Clients submit detailed questionnaire
2. AI matches them with 3 best-fit advisors (based on specialty, style, location)
3. You get intro'd to pre-qualified, ready-to-engage clients
4. Only pay 20% referral fee if you close the deal

Would love to send you your first matched client this week.

Can you complete your profile here? [Link to I MATCH signup]

Takes 5 minutes, and you'll start receiving matches immediately.

Best,
James

**Response 2: "What's the catch?"**
```
Hi {first_name},

No catch! It's genuinely free to join:

- $0 to create profile
- $0 per match introduction
- $0 unless you close the deal

If you close: 20% referral fee (one-time or annual, your choice)

Example:
- You close $5,000/year client
- You pay $1,000 referral fee
- You keep $4,000 recurring revenue

Most advisors see 3-5x ROI in first month.

Best,
James

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Not getting responses?**
- ✅ Personalize more (mention something from their profile)
- ✅ Try different template (switch to pain_point_approach)
- ✅ Target smaller firms (more receptive)

**Getting connection requests declined?**
- ✅ Remove pitch from connection request, just connect
- ✅ Send message AFTER connected
- ✅ Comment on their posts first (build rapport)

**LinkedIn restricting your account?**
- ✅ Slow down (10/day max, not 20)
- ✅ Vary your message (don't copy-paste identical)
- ✅ Wait longer between sends (30 min minimum)

---

## NEXT STEP

1. Read TARGET_LIST.md (learn how to find targets)
2. Spend 1 hour building list of 50 advisors
3. Send first 10 messages tomorrow morning (5 min)
4. Track results and optimize

**Goal:** 50 messages this week = 5 interested leads = 3 I MATCH signups = $180/month recurring

Let's go! 🚀
