# Domain Strategy for Full Potential Ecosystem

**Managing multiple brands under the conscious circulation model**

---

## Overview

Our organizational structure has three distinct levels, each with its own purpose and audience:
1. **Spiritual/Community** (Cora Nation, Church of Consciousness, White Rock Ministry)
2. **Asset Holding** (Sunheart Private Trust - private, no public domain)
3. **Operating Services** (Full Potential portfolio)

Each level needs appropriate web presence aligned with its mission and audience.
