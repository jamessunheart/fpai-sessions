Running an experiment that might fail.

I built an AI system to test if Claude can match people with financial advisors better than Google.

Why this matters to me:
My dad's been a CFP for years. Generic lead services send him terrible matches - people who can't afford his services or don't align with his approach.

Meanwhile, my friends struggle to find advisors who understand tech compensation (RSUs, ISOs, tax optimization).

So I'm testing: Can AI understand compatibility?

The experiment:
✓ Customer describes their needs
✓ AI analyzes advisor profiles
✓ Matches based on specialization + values + style
✓ Free for customers to try

Current status:
• Zero customers
• Infrastructure works
• Don't know if this is useful yet

Testing at: http://198.54.123.234:8401

(Yes it's an IP address - testing the matching before polishing the website)

What I want to learn:
1. Will people trust AI recommendations for something this important?
2. Can AI judge human compatibility well enough?
3. Is this actually better than Googling "financial advisor near me"?

Honest feedback welcome. Will report back in 30 days whether this worked or was a dead end.
