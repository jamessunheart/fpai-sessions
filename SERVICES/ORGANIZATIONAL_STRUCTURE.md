## Revenue Flow

### How Money Circulates

```
1. OPERATING COMPANIES generate revenue
   ├─ I MATCH: Commissions on matches (10-40%)
   ├─ Coaching: Session fees, memberships
   ├─ Treasury: Management fees, performance fees
   ├─ AI Services: Subscriptions, project fees
   └─ Others: Various service revenues

2. COMPANIES owned by SUNHEART TRUST
   ├─ Profits flow to Trust (as owner)
   ├─ Trust pays operating expenses
   ├─ Trust retains reserves for growth/IP development
   └─ Trust distributes remaining profits to beneficiary

3. TRUST distributes to CHURCH OF CONSCIOUSNESS
   ├─ Church receives distributions as beneficiary
   ├─ Church uses funds for mission:
   │  ├─ White Rock Ministry operations
   │  ├─ Community support and programs
   │  ├─ Spiritual services and gatherings
   │  ├─ Charitable activities
   │  └─ Cora Nation member benefits
   └─ Tax-exempt (508 status)

4. CONSCIOUS CIRCULATION COMPLETE
   └─ Resources circulate consciously for human flourishing
```

**Example:**
- I MATCH generates $10M revenue
- After expenses ($4M), profit is $6M
- $6M flows to Sunheart Trust
- Trust retains $2M for growth/reserves
- Trust distributes $4M to Church of Consciousness
- Church uses $4M for mission (tax-free)
- Mission supports community flourishing
- Flourishing community uses/refers services
- Cycle repeats at larger scale

---

## Why This Structure?

### Tax Optimization
- **508(c)(1)(a) Church:** All income tax-exempt, no IRS approval needed
- **Trust:** Flexibility in timing distributions to minimize taxes
- **Operating Companies:** Can deduct reasonable expenses before profit

**Combined Effect:** Significantly lower effective tax rate vs traditional corporate structure

### Asset Protection
- **Trust Ownership:** IP protected from operating company lawsuits
- **Separate Entities:** Liability contained within each operating company
- **Church Status:** Additional legal protections for religious activities

### Mission Alignment
- **Conscious Circulation:** Profits explicitly flow to spiritual/community mission
- **Values-Driven:** Structure embodies the philosophy (not just profit-seeking)
- **Stakeholder Model:** Community (church members) are the ultimate beneficiaries

### Privacy
- **Trust:** Ownership details remain private
- **PMA (Cora Nation):** Membership and activities private
- **508 Church:** No public 990 filing requirement (unlike 501(c)(3))

### Flexibility
- **Add Services:** Easy to launch new companies under Trust
- **Distribute Profits:** Trust can time distributions based on church needs
- **Governance:** Church and PMA can self-govern according to beliefs

---

### Brand Positioning

- **White Rock Ministry** - "Church guidance for personal transformation" (service)

---

## Legal Considerations

### Formation Status
- [ ] Church of Consciousness - 508(c)(1)(a) declaration filed
- [ ] Cora Nation - PMA agreement signed by members
- [ ] Sunheart Private Trust - Trust document executed
- [ ] Operating Companies - LLCs formed (or single LLC with DBAs)

### Ongoing Compliance
- **Church:** Maintain religious activities, avoid prohibited political activity
- **Trust:** File trust tax return (1041) annually
- **Operating Companies:** File business returns, maintain separate finances
- **PMA:** Maintain private status, member agreements

### Banking
- **Church:** Church bank account (donations, distributions)
- **Trust:** Trust bank account (receives company profits, distributes to church)
- **Each Operating Company:** Separate business account

### Documentation
- [ ] Church doctrine and statement of faith
- [ ] PMA operating agreement and member agreements
- [ ] Trust agreement (irrevocable)
- [ ] Company operating agreements
- [ ] Written agreements for all transfers (companies → trust → church)

---
