## 💼 POST #2: LinkedIn Professional Launch

**COPY THIS NOW:**

```
Finding the right service provider is broken.

I spent 20+ hours researching executive coaches last year. Read dozens of websites. Still felt uncertain.

Then I spent another 15 hours helping a friend find church formation services. Same problem.

So I built something better.

An AI that does the hard work for you:

✓ Analyzes your specific needs (2-minute form)
✓ Evaluates compatibility across 5 factors
✓ Finds your top 3 matches in 24 hours
✓ Sets up free consultations with each

Currently live for:
• Executive Coaching
• Church Formation (501c3/508c1a)
• AI Development & Automation

This is a soft launch - testing with a small group first.

If you (or someone in your network) could use this:

What do you think? Does this solve a real problem?

**Follow-up:** Engage with comments, thank everyone

## 🎯 POST #3: The Controversial Take (Twitter Thread)

**TWEET 1:**
```
Hot take: Spending 30+ hours "researching" service providers is a waste of time.

Your time is worth $100-500/hour. That's $3,000-15,000 in opportunity cost.

Just pay an AI $0 to do it in 24 hours.

Thread on why "doing your research" is actually expensive 👇
```

**TWEET 2:**
```
The "research process" most people use:

1. Google search (2 hrs)
2. Read 50+ websites (10 hrs)
3. Compare pricing (3 hrs)
4. Check reviews (5 hrs)
5. Schedule calls (4 hrs)
6. Follow up (2 hrs)
7. Make decision (4 hrs)

Total: 30+ hours
```

**TWEET 3:**
```
Meanwhile, an AI can:

• Analyze your exact needs in seconds
• Match you with compatible providers
• Rank by 5 compatibility factors
• Deliver results in 24 hours

Cost: $0
Time: 2 minutes

Try it: https://fullpotential.com/get-matched
```

**TWEET 4:**
```
"But I need to do my research!"

You should. But you should research THE MATCHES, not browse randomly.

Get 3 AI-vetted matches → Research those 3 deeply → Make informed decision

Work smarter, not harder.

## 💬 POST #6: Reddit Value Comment (Template)

**Use this when you see someone asking for recommendations:**

```
Finding the right [executive coach/consultant/developer] is tough. Here's what worked for me:

1. **Define specific goals** - Not just "get better at leadership" but "scale team from 5 to 25 people in 12 months"

2. **Match experience to your industry** - A coach who worked with tech startups understands different challenges than retail

3. **Communication style matters** - Some coaches are direct/confrontational, others are supportive/nurturing. Know what works for you.

4. **Budget realistically** - Good [coaches/consultants] are $5K-15K+ for real transformation. If cheaper, ask why.

5. **Check methodology** - Do they use assessments? Frameworks? Ad hoc? Make sure it aligns.

I actually spent 20+ hours on this process last year, then built an AI that automates the matching (analyzes 5 compatibility factors). Happy to share the link if useful - not trying to sell, genuinely think it could save you time.

[Only share link if they respond positively asking for it]
```

**Subreddits to monitor:**
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/smallbusiness
- r/startups
- r/Christianity (for church formation)
- r/Coaches

**Strategy:** Value FIRST, link only if requested

👋 Maker here! Happy to answer any questions.

I built this after spending 20+ hours finding an executive coach and still feeling uncertain. There had to be a better way.

The AI considers:
✓ Expertise match
✓ Values alignment
✓ Communication style
✓ Location compatibility
✓ Budget fit

Then ranks providers by total compatibility score. Not just search - actual matching.
