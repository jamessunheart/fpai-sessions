# Upwork Job: Mission-Aligned Content Writer - Full Potential AI

**Category:** Writing > Blog Writing
**Experience Level:** Intermediate to Expert
**Duration:** Ongoing partnership (monthly retainer)

## Who We Are

We're Full Potential AI, and we're building tools that free humans from busywork so they can focus on what only they can create.

This isn't about "replacing workers with AI." It's about liberating humans to reach their full potential.

We're looking for a writer who gets that. Who believes work should energize, not exhaust. Who wants to help reshape how humans and AI work together.

## What You'll Write

12 blog posts per month that **inspire humans** to imagine what's possible:

**Topics**:
- "What would you create with 20 extra hours per week?"
- "Why AI should never replace humans (and what it should do instead)"
- "The CEO who codes one day per week (because it brings him joy)"
- "How to build a business in paradise on earth"
- Stories of founders who reclaimed their time and their vision

**Not this**: "10 ways to automate your business"
**But this**: "What happens when humans are free to be fully human?"

**Format**:
- 1,500-2,000 words
- Mission-aligned (profit AND purpose, not profit vs purpose)
- SEO optimized (yes, we want traffic - but with integrity)
- Markdown format with meta descriptions

## What Makes This Different

**We pay above market rate** - because we model abundance, not scarcity.

**We give you creative freedom** - you're not a content mill writer. You're a partner in spreading a message that matters.

**We share the mission** - you'll understand the "why" behind what we're building. You'll talk to our customers. You'll see the impact.

**We invest in your growth** - want to learn about AI? We'll teach you. Want to improve your craft? We'll give you feedback and resources.

## Required Skills

- **Writing that moves people** (not just informs them)
- B2B SaaS experience (you understand the audience)
- Genuine curiosity about AI and human potential
- Ability to write about technology with heart
- SEO knowledge (but never at the expense of soul)

## Deliverables

- 12 blog posts/month in Markdown format
- Meta descriptions and title tags
- Internal linking suggestions
- Monthly performance report (traffic + qualitative feedback)
- Ideas for future content based on what resonates

## How to Apply

This isn't just a writing gig. This is a chance to help reshape how humans and AI work together.

**To apply, answer these questions:**

1. **Share 2-3 writing samples** (B2B/tech preferred, but show us your best work)

2. **What's your relationship with work?**
   - Do you love what you do? Do you wish you had more time for it? Tell us honestly.

3. **What would YOU create if you had 20 extra hours per week?**
   - This is the question we ask our customers. We want to know your answer.

4. **Why does this job description resonate with you?**
   - Or does it? Be honest. We want the right fit, not any fit.

5. **Can you start this week?**

But also:
- ✅ Comments from readers saying "this made me think differently"
