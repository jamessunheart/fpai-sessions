# Worthy Recipient Allocation System

**Purpose:** Use AI to allocate material blessings (vehicles, resources, opportunities) to worthy recipients based on spiritual merit, contribution, and need.

## 🎯 Mission

Manifest heaven on Earth by ensuring resources flow to those aligned with consciousness expansion and human flourishing.

## 📊 WORTHINESS SCORING ALGORITHM

### Criteria (Weighted):

**1. Founding Supporter Status (40%)**
- 2X CORA holder = 80+ points
- 1X CORA holder = 40 points
- Non-supporter = 10 points
- Higher monthly support = higher score

**2. Mission Alignment (25%)**
- Understanding of consciousism
- Commitment to human flourishing
- Track record of service
- Values alignment assessment (AI evaluated)

**3. Material Need (20%)**
- Current vehicle situation
- Impact on life/work
- Geographic necessity (LA sprawl = higher need)
- Financial hardship consideration

**4. Intended Use (15%)**
- Will vehicle advance the mission?
- Plans to use for consciousness expansion?
- Community benefit?
- Not for ego/status

**5. Community Vouching (10%)**
- Other supporters vouch for them
- Reputation in community
- Trust factor

### Scoring Example:

```
Candidate A:
- Founding supporter: $200/month (2X CORA) = 90/100 points × 0.40 = 36
- Mission alignment: Strong understanding = 85/100 × 0.25 = 21.25
- Material need: No car, needs for work = 80/100 × 0.20 = 16
- Intended use: Use for mission outreach = 75/100 × 0.15 = 11.25
- Community vouching: 3 vouches = 70/100 × 0.10 = 7

Total Worthiness Score: 91.5/100
```
