Hey [Name],

I wanted to share something I just launched that might be helpful for you or someone you know.

I built an AI-powered matching service that connects people with top-tier service providers in three areas:

🎯 Executive Coaching - for leaders seeking personal transformation
⛪ Church Formation - for forming 501(c)(3) or 508(c)(1)(A) churches
🤖 AI Development - for businesses wanting to automate with AI

How it works:
1. Fill out a 2-minute form describing your needs
2. AI analyzes and finds your best matches
3. Get 3 personalized provider recommendations within 24 hours
4. Free consultation with each one

The matching algorithm considers expertise, values alignment, communication style, location, and pricing to find the best fit.

If any of these resonate with you (or someone you know), check it out:
👉 https://fullpotential.com/get-matched

No obligation, no spam - just better matches.

[Your Name]

P.S. This is a soft launch, so I'd love any feedback!

🎯 Launching: AI-Powered Service Provider Matching

After months of development, I'm excited to share a new matching platform that solves a real problem: finding the right service provider is hard.

Too many options. Not enough information. Endless research.

So we built an AI that does it for you.

Tell us what you need → AI finds your perfect matches → Free consultations

Currently matching for:
• Executive Coaching (personal transformation)
• Church Formation (501c3/508c1a)
• AI Development & Automation

The algorithm analyzes 5 compatibility factors to find providers that truly fit your needs, not just generic search results.

This is a soft launch - testing with a small group first. If you (or someone you know) could use any of these services, check it out:

Would love your feedback!

**Option B - Story-Driven**
```
Finding the right service provider is broken.

I spent 20+ hours researching executive coaches last year. Read dozens of websites. Still felt uncertain.

Then I spent another 15 hours helping a friend find church formation services. Same problem.

So I built something better.

An AI that does the hard work for you:
✓ Analyzes your specific needs
✓ Evaluates compatibility across 5 factors
✓ Finds your top 3 matches in 24 hours
✓ Sets up free consultations with each

Currently live for:
• Executive Coaching
• Church Formation (501c3/508c1a)
• AI Development & Automation

This is a soft launch - invite only for now.

**Option C - Question Hook**
```
Quick question:

How long did it take you to find your last:
- Executive coach?
- Consultant?

For most people: 10-30 hours of research.

We built an AI that does it in 24 hours.

Here's how:
1. Tell us your needs (2-min form)
2. AI evaluates providers on 5 compatibility factors
3. Get your top 3 matches with reasoning
4. Free consultation with each

Services we match:
🎯 Executive Coaching
⛪ Church Formation
🤖 AI Development

Soft launching today with a small group.
