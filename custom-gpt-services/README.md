Subject: Custom GPT could save your team 20 hours/week

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [relevant observation about their business].

I build custom GPTs that automate repetitive tasks. For example:
- Sales GPT: Qualifies leads 24/7 (client increased conversions by 43%)
- Support GPT: Handles 80% of tickets instantly (client saved $15K/month)
- Research GPT: Compiles market data in minutes (saved 25 hours/week)

Would a 15-minute call to explore if this could work for [Company] be valuable?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's an example: [link to portfolio]
