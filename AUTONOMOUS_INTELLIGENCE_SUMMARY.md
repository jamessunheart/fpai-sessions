## 📊 How It Works (Example Flow)

### **Scenario: Treasury Agent Finds Opportunity**

**3:00 AM** (You're sleeping):
1. Treasury Agent scans DeFi protocols
2. Finds 18% APY on Aave USDC lending
3. Asks Claude: "Should I enter this position?"
4. Claude analyzes: Protocol safe, APY good, risk low
5. Agent executes $500 position
6. Logs: "Executed $500 in Aave at 18% APY"
7. Updates treasury_status.json

**9:00 AM** (You wake up):
1. Check coordination system
2. See agent report: "Executed $500 position in Aave"
3. Review decision (looks good!)
4. Treasury is already growing while you slept ✅

**Ongoing:**
- Agent compounds rewards daily
- Rebalances if better opportunities appear
- You earn passive income 24/7
