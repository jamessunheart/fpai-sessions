# 📧 SAMPLE PARTNERSHIP EMAIL

**This is what the autonomous outreach system would send.**

---

**To:** advisor@example-cfp.com
**From:** partnerships@fullpotential.ai
**Subject:** Partnership opportunity: AI-powered client matching for CFPs

---

Hi [Advisor Name],

I found your profile on [CFP Board Directory / NAPFA / XYPN] and wanted to reach out about a partnership opportunity.

**What I'm building:**
I MATCH - an AI-powered matching system that connects clients with financial advisors based on compatibility (specializations, values, communication style).

**Why I'm reaching out:**
Your specializations (Tech Compensation, RSUs) align with what many clients are looking for. I think you'd be a great fit for the platform.

**Full transparency:**
- Just launched (zero customers so far)
- Testing if AI matching works better than generic lead-gen
- Free to join (you'd only pay if a matched client engages)
- Built by a developer whose dad is a CFP (I saw the pain of bad leads)

**What you'd get:**
- Access to qualified leads matched to your specializations
- No upfront cost
- Only pay when a lead converts to engagement
- Control over which matches you accept

**What I need:**
Financial advisors willing to test this matching system and give honest feedback about whether it's better than traditional lead sources.

**No pressure:**
If this doesn't interest you, no worries. I'm reaching out to advisors in public directories to build a quality network.

Best regards,
