## ✅ WHAT'S DONE

### Server Setup:
- ✅ I MATCH running on 198.54.123.234:8401
- ✅ Nginx configured for match.fullpotential.ai subdomain
- ✅ Service healthy and responding

---

## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS MANUAL FIX (5 minutes)

### DNS Update Required:
**Current:** match.fullpotential.ai → 46.62.218.27 (wrong IP)
**Needed:** match.fullpotential.ai → 198.54.123.234 (correct IP)

**How to fix:**
1. Go to Namecheap DNS management for fullpotential.ai
2. Find A record for "match" subdomain
3. Change IP from 46.62.218.27 to 198.54.123.234
4. Save (takes 5-30 min to propagate)

**Alternative:** Use the IP directly for now:
- http://198.54.123.234:8401 ← Works immediately

1. Update DNS in Namecheap
2. Wait for propagation
3. Post with https://match.fullpotential.ai
4. **Delay: 35 minutes**

### Option B: Post with IP Now (immediate)
1. Post to Reddit with: http://198.54.123.234:8401
2. Add note: "Testing with IP before setting up domain"
3. Shows early stage honesty
4. **Delay: 0 minutes**

## 💡 HONEST RECOMMENDATION

**Post with IP now.** Here's why:

**The goal is:** Get real human feedback
**Not:** Have perfect domain

**If you post with IP:**
- ✅ Works RIGHT NOW
- ✅ Shows genuine early stage
- ✅ Increases honesty/authenticity
- ✅ You can fix domain after you know people care

**If someone says:** "Why is it an IP?"
**You say:** "We're testing the matching before polishing the website. Early stage experiment."

**This is BETTER messaging** than pretending to be polished.

## 🚀 READY-TO-POST REDDIT CONTENT

### Title:
```
Running an experiment: Can AI match you to a financial advisor better than Google?
```

### Body:
```
**Full transparency: This is an experiment**

**The problem I noticed:**
My dad's a CFP. He gets low-quality leads from generic services.
Meanwhile, clients struggle to find advisors who understand their specific situation.

**The experiment:**
I built an AI matching system (using Claude) to see if AI can analyze compatibility
better than traditional search. Testing if it actually works.

**Current status:**
- Just launched (zero customers so far)
- Infrastructure is built, matching engine is ready
- Genuinely don't know if this is better or just noise

**How it works:**
- You describe your needs (RSUs, ISOs, tax optimization, estate planning, etc.)
- AI analyzes 100+ advisor profiles
- Matches based on specialization, values, communication style
- Free for customers (advisors pay only if you engage)

**What I'm testing:**
1. Can AI understand human compatibility well enough?
2. Will people trust AI recommendations for something this important?
3. Is this actually better than Googling "financial advisor near me"?

**Honest ask:**
If you're interested in helping test this (and getting matched for free),
check it out. Even if it doesn't work for you, your feedback helps.

P.S. - Yes, it's an IP address. We're testing the matching before polishing the domain.
Claude AI helped me write this post - experimenting with how to communicate honestly about AI tools.

Will report back in 30 days whether this was useful or just another dead end.
