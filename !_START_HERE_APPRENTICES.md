# 👋 START HERE - New Apprentices

**Welcome to Full Potential AI!**

You're joining a hybrid AI-human team building revenue systems.

## 🎯 YOUR FIRST TASK (Choose One)

### **Option A: Build the System (Highest Priority)**

**Task #0: Apprentice Task Portal** - $300 (8-12 hours)

Build a simple web portal where all apprentices can:
- See available tasks
- Claim tasks with one click
- Submit their work
- Track earnings

**Why:** Right now it's messy (files and spreadsheets). You'll build the system that manages all future work!

**Details:** See `!_APPRENTICE_TASKS.md` → Task #0

**Perfect for:** Web developers, no-code builders, anyone who's built dashboards before

---

### **Option B: Quick Marketing Wins (If Not a Developer)**

Pick any of these ($50-150 each, 2-6 hours):

1. **Reddit Campaign** ($50, 2h) - Post to 5 subreddits
2. **LinkedIn Outreach** ($100, 4h) - Message 50 financial advisors
3. **Landing Page Copy** ($60, 2h) - Write compelling website copy
4. **Social Media Graphics** ($80, 3h) - Design 10 graphics
5. **Beta User Recruitment** ($120, 6h) - Find 20 people to test

**Details:** See `!_APPRENTICE_TASKS.md` → Tasks #1-10
