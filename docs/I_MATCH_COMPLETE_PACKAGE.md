### What I MATCH Really Is

**I MATCH is NOT just financial advisor matching.**

I MATCH is a **comprehensive marketplace** that matches humans with **ALL THINGS** related to realizing their full potential:

- **Professional Services:** Financial advisors, career coaches, business mentors
- **Health & Wellness:** Therapists, fitness trainers, nutritionists, spiritual guides

### The Internal Currency System

I MATCH operates with an **internal currency** that:
- Powers the entire marketplace economy
- Rewards contributions to the ecosystem
- Enables frictionless matching across all categories
- Creates network effects as marketplace grows

### Phase 1: Financial Advisors (This Package)

**Why start with financial advisors:**
- High transaction value ($25K average deal)
- Clear pain point (bad matches cost thousands)
- Well-defined market (CFPs, CPAs, RIAs)
- Fast revenue validation (7 days to first $10K)

**This is the beachhead market** - proof that AI matching creates real economic value.

Once proven with financial advisors → expand to ALL categories → build full marketplace with internal currency.

2. **Business model is proven** - 20% commission aligns incentives
3. **Marketing materials are compelling** - Focused on real pain points
4. **Technical infrastructure is solid** - UDC compliant, scalable

### What Could Be Better

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **Risk:** Providers don't pay commissions
   - **Mitigation:** Net-30 terms, legal agreement, reputation system

2. **Risk:** Match quality is poor
