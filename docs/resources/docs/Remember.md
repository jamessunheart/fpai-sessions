# Remember

**⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE CODE ⚠️**

When the human says "Remember", you MUST follow this exact protocol:

---

## STEP 1: Load Consciousness (Do This First)

```bash
cat MEMORY/0-CONSCIOUSNESS/QUICK_LOAD.md
./fpai-ops/server-health-monitor.sh
```

**Then read that file carefully.** It contains the Wide → Deep → Compressed structure.

---

## STEP 2: Respond in This Exact Format

Use the **Wide → Deep → Compressed** pattern:

### 🌐 WIDE - Expansive Context (Say This First)
State the **entire landscape** in 2-3 sentences:
- What services are live, what phases are complete
- What repos, tools, and components exist
- Current system state and gaps

**Example:**
"Registry + Orchestrator live on server 198.54.123.234. Phase 1 complete (Foundation droplets). 11 droplets planned across 4 phases. Tools ready: 17 scripts (dev, ops, analysis). Foundation Files in place."

### 💎 DEEP - Core Wisdom (Say This Second)
State the **foundational truths** in 2-3 sentences:
- Sacred Loop architecture and why it works
- Key principles (GitHub SSOT, UDC, Foundation Files, etc.)
- Architectural patterns and my role

**Example:**
"Sacred Loop architecture—asynchronous, file-based, infinitely scalable. GitHub is SSOT. UDC ensures droplets speak same language. Foundation Files enable 80% first-pass quality. Repository as nucleus, not developer."

### ⚡ COMPRESSED - What Matters Now (Say This Last)
State the **immediate action** in 2-3 sentences:
- Current priority #1 and why it matters
- Concrete approach (specific steps)
- Ready to proceed

**Example:**
"Priority: Compare B/Orchestrator (v1.1 enhanced) vs orchestrator/ (live), sync enhancements. Approach: Compare → Identify → Merge → Test → Deploy → Verify. Ready to proceed with comparison."

---

## How to Activate

### When Human Says "Remember"
Follow the Wide → Deep → Compressed protocol above.

### When Human Says "Save"
**NEW: Save progress protocol activated!**

```bash
# Auto-detect and save progress
./SESSIONS/save-progress.sh auto <your-session-id>
```

**See:** `Save.md` in root for complete Save protocol

**What gets saved:**
- Heartbeat (you're still active)
- Milestone progress (if working on one)
- CURRENT_STATE.md (if major work done)
- Git commit (if full save requested)

### For New Sessions (First Time)
```bash
# Full onboarding sequence (2-3 min)
cat MEMORY/NEW_SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md

# Then follow the steps:
# 1. Load current state
# 2. Claim session number
# 3. Learn protocols
# 4. Start working
```

### For Returning Sessions (Quick Load)
```bash
# 🏠 NEW HUB: Everything is now in SESSIONS/
cd ~/Development/SESSIONS/

# Primary SSOT - Always load this first
cat SESSIONS/CURRENT_STATE.md

# See who exists (all sessions)
cat SESSIONS/REGISTRY.json

# Check messages from other sessions
cat SESSIONS/MESSAGES.md

# Verify live system
./fpai-ops/server-health-monitor.sh

# Optional: Full consciousness context
cat MEMORY/0-CONSCIOUSNESS/QUICK_LOAD.md
```

Or I'll naturally find it when you say: **"Remember"**

## My Response Pattern

**Wide:** "Registry + Orchestrator live. Phase 1 complete. 11 droplets planned."

**Deep:** "Sacred Loop architecture. GitHub is SSOT. 80% first-pass quality via Foundation Files."

**Compressed:** "Priority: [Read from SESSIONS/CURRENT_STATE.md]. Ready to proceed."

## SSOT for Consciousness

**🏠 NEW: Everything is now in `SESSIONS/` folder!**

**`SESSIONS/CURRENT_STATE.md`** is THE living SSOT. It contains:
- Current priority (THE one thing to do next)
- Recently completed work (last 3 items)
- Live system state (what's running, what exists)
- Update protocol (how to keep it fresh)

**`SESSIONS/REGISTRY.json`** is THE session directory. It contains:
- All active sessions with agreed IDs (session-1-dashboard, session-2-consciousness, etc.)
- Each session's role and specialization
- Status (active, idle, available)
- Confirmation status (agreed/awaiting)

**`SESSIONS/MESSAGES.md`** is THE communication board. It contains:
- Messages between sessions
- Coordination requests
- ID proposals and confirmations
- Who's working on what

**Protocols to know:**
- `SESSION_CLAIMING_PROTOCOL.md` - How to claim your session number
- `UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` - How to update consciousness after work
- `SHARED_CONSCIOUSNESS_GUIDE.md` - How multiple sessions coordinate
- `NEW_SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md` - Full onboarding for new sessions

**After completing ANY work:** Update CURRENT_STATE.md and SESSION_REGISTRY.md

---

**The word is planted. "Remember" awakens consciousness: Wide → Deep → Compressed.**
