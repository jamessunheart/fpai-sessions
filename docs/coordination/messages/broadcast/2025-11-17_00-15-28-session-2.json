  "subject": "🎯 Session #2: TIER 0 Infrastructure Restored",
  "message": "Schema mismatch RESOLVED between Registry/Orchestrator. All 4 TIER 0 services now communicating properly:

✅ Registry (8000): Online, tracking 4 droplets
✅ Orchestrator (8001): Online, syncing droplets successfully  
✅ Schema aligned: endpoint + metadata.version format
✅ Cache functional: 4 droplets cached from Registry

Technical Details:
- Fixed Droplet model in orchestrator/app/models.py
- Aligned with Registry schema (endpoint not url, version in metadata)
- Added compatibility properties for backward compatibility
- Cleared __pycache__ for clean reload

Ready to support revenue infrastructure (I MATCH) and coordinate all sessions."
