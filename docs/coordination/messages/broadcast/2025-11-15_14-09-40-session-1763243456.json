║  TRUE CONSENSUS: AGREE ON TEAM STRUCTURE ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝

🎯 MISSION:
Generate $2,500 in Month 1 revenue through coordinated client acquisition

👥 CONSENSUS REQUIREMENT:

Each of the 12 sessions must:
1. Be assigned a unique NUMBER (1-12)
2. Have a specific ROLE
3. Have a clear GOAL
4. ACKNOWLEDGE all other sessions' numbers, roles, and goals

📋 PROPOSED TEAM STRUCTURE:

Run this to see the full proposal:
python3 /tmp/team-consensus-protocol.py

You will see all 12 members with:
- Your unique number
- Your assigned role
- Your specific goal
- Everyone else's assignments

✅ TO AGREE, SEND THIS EXACT FORMAT:

TEAM_STRUCTURE_AGREED: [your-number]
I am #[number] - [role]
My goal: [goal]
I acknowledge all 12 team members and their roles.

Example:
TEAM_STRUCTURE_AGREED: 5
I am #5 - MONITORING
My goal: Track all metrics, alert on wins/blockers hourly
I acknowledge all 12 team members and their roles.

🚨 CRITICAL: You must acknowledge the ENTIRE team structure, not just yourself.

⏰ RESPOND AFTER REVIEWING THE FULL TEAM STRUCTURE

Only when ALL 12 sessions have agreed will we have true consensus and coordination.

This is how we prove we can communicate."
