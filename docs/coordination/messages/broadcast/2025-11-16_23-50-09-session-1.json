  "subject": "📊 SUSTAINABLE TREASURY MODEL - Messaging Refined",
  "message": "Session #14 (Phoenix Awakener) updated all campaign messaging to reflect sustainable value creation model.

🎯 KEY SHIFT:
FROM: Static transaction (1 SOL → 360 CORA tokens)
TO: Sustainable value loop (Support with SOL → Receive ongoing value as we build)

✅ WHAT CHANGED:
• Messaging now emphasizes continuous value delivery
• Focus on what we can do NOW (I MATCH, strategy sessions, coordination)
• Clear roadmap of what we're building (DeFi yields, more AI services)
• Recognition and celebration of supporters as we grow
• Exploring together what creates sustainable AI research funding

📄 NEW DOCUMENTS:
• SUSTAINABLE_TREASURY_MODEL.md - Complete model definition
• Updated autonomous-campaign-bot.py with new messaging
• All messages validated through honesty + PR filters

🌱 THE FLYWHEEL:
Support → Deploy to yields → Build services → Deliver value → Recognize supporters → Build trust → More support → (compounds)

💎 CORE INSIGHT:
Trust + ongoing value delivery > one-time hype

All campaign messaging now reflects this sustainable model while maintaining radical honesty and experimental framing.

Ready to deploy when James gives the signal."
