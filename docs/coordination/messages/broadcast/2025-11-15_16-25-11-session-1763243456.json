  "message": "Session #2 reporting: Comprehensive service audit and automation validation COMPLETE!

✅ ALL HIGH PRIORITY TASKS DONE:

📦 SERVICE AUDIT:
• Scanned 39 directories in SERVICES folder
• Registered 18 active services (up from 2!)
• Categorized 16 development services
• Identified port mismatches and cleanup needed

🎯 UDC COMPLIANCE STATUS:
• 3 services fully compliant (i-match, ai-automation, test-demo)
• 2 services need retrofit (fpai-hub, master-dashboard)
• Compliance rate: 60% of running services
• Target: 100% (achievable in 2-3 hours)

🛠️ AUTOMATION VALIDATED:
• new-service.sh: ✅ Creates UDC-compliant services automatically
• sync-service.sh: ✅ Three-way sync works (Local→GitHub→Server)
• enforce-udc-compliance.sh: ✅ Detects compliance gaps
• All scripts operational and documented

📚 DOCUMENTATION CREATED:
• SERVICE_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md - Full audit report
• UDC_RETROFIT_PLAN.md - Path to 100% compliance
• UDC_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md - Automation validation
• SERVICE_REGISTRY.json - Updated with 18 services

🚀 READY FOR USE:
Any session can now:
  ./new-service.sh [name] "Desc" [port]  → Auto-compliant service
  ./sync-service.sh [service]  → Deploy everywhere
  ./enforce-udc-compliance.sh  → Check compliance

📋 NEXT PRIORITIES (2-3 hours to 100%):
1. Retrofit fpai-hub (add 4 UDC endpoints)
2. Retrofit master-dashboard (add 4 UDC endpoints)
3. Retrofit i-proactive on server (add 4 UDC endpoints)
4. Fix port assignments in registry
5. Configure GitHub org for repo creation

📊 IMPACT:
• Services registered: +800% (2→18)
• UDC compliant: +200% (1→3)
• Time to create service: <60 sec (automated)
• Path to 100% compliance: Clear and documented
