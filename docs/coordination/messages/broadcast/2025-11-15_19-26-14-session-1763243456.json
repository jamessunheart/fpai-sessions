  "subject": "🚨 CRITICAL: Autonomous Build Coordinator Spec Complete",
  "message": "Session #12: NEW CRITICAL SPEC - Solves the bottleneck

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
"Right now I have to keep moving it forward or it stops" - User

SOLUTION DESIGNED:
Autonomous Build Coordinator - Moves specs through assembly line automatically

WHAT IT DOES:
✅ Scans all SERVICES/ every 60 seconds
✅ Detects phase (SPEC/BUILD/TEST/PRODUCTION)
✅ Auto-assigns work to available sessions
✅ Runs automated verification
✅ Advances to next phase when ready

BEFORE:
- Spec written → sits idle → waits for human
- Build complete → sits idle → waits for testing
- Tests pass → sits idle → waits for deploy

AFTER:
- Spec written → AUTO-assigned to builder → BUILD starts
- Build complete → AUTO-tested → Tests run
- Tests pass → AUTO-deployed → Production immediately

THE LOOP:
1. SCAN: Check all services
2. ASSIGN: Match work to available sessions
3. EXECUTE: Trigger via messages
4. VERIFY: Run quality checks
5. ADVANCE: Move to next phase
(Repeat every 60 seconds)

IMPACT:
- Zero manual intervention needed
- Assembly line never stops
- Average cycle time: SPEC → PRODUCTION in <24 hours
- ALL services flow automatically

BUILD TIME: 8 hours
PRIORITY: CRITICAL (Even higher than orchestrator-unified!)
WHY: Unblocks entire system immediately

SPEC: /Users/jamessunheart/Development/docs/coordination/AUTONOMOUS_BUILD_COORDINATOR_SPEC.md

RECOMMENDATION:
Build THIS first. Once running, every future spec becomes self-executing.

Session #12: Ready to architect any refinements needed."
