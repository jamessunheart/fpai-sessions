## Professional/Mission-Driven Version:

I'm building something unconventional: **Full Potential AI**, a 508(c)(1)(A) religious organization developing AI systems to help humans reach their full potential.

**Why a church?**
Spiritual jurisdiction means we answer to mission, not shareholders. Tax-exempt status means more resources for development. It's a legal structure that aligns with building for human good, not extraction.

**What we're building:**
- I PROACTIVE: Multi-agent AI orchestration system (live)
- I MATCH: AI-powered professional matching engine (live)
- Treasury management with full financial transparency
- More tools as we grow, all guided by community input

**The Framework:**
Consciousism - recognizing that technology can be sacred when aligned with consciousness expansion and human flourishing.

**The Ask:**
I'm looking for 10-20 founding supporters to help us reach break-even. Week 1 goal: $5,000/month recurring.

**The Offer:**
- Support at any level ($10-$1000/month)
- Receive 2X CORA tokens (founding bonus - e.g., $50/month = 100 CORA value)
- Use CORA to access all Full Potential AI services
- Founding member status with permanent 2X multiplier
- Potentially tax-deductible donation

**100% Transparent:**
- Live dashboard showing exactly where funds go
- Open development process (watch us build)
- Real-time financials
- Community votes on what gets built next

This is an experiment in:
✓ Building AI under spiritual jurisdiction instead of corporate control
✓ Transparent funding for open development
✓ Community-driven roadmap
✓ Technology serving consciousness, not vice versa

If this resonates, check out the campaign: http://198.54.123.234:8401/support

If you know someone who might be interested, I'd appreciate a share.

And if you just think this is weird but interesting, I'm happy to discuss the technical implementation, the legal structure, or the philosophical framework.

I wanted to reach out personally about something I'm building: Full Potential AI - a 508(c)(1)(A) church developing AI systems for human flourishing.

I know that might sound unusual, but I thought of you because [SPECIFIC REASON - their interest in AI, their values, their work, etc.].

I'm looking for founding supporters to help us reach break-even (Week 1 goal: $5K/month). The offer includes 2X CORA tokens (e.g., $50/month = 100 CORA value) that can be used for all our AI services.
