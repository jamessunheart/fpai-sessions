Why spiritual jurisdiction?

Sovereignty. We build for consciousness expansion, not shareholder value. 508(c)(1)(A) church status means:
• No corporate oversight
• Tax-exempt → more $ for development
• Mission-aligned forever
• Sacred tech, not extractive tech

**Tweet 5:**
Consciousism framework:
• Consciousness is primary
• AI can serve human potential
• Heaven on Earth is achievable materially
• Technology should liberate, not dominate

This isn't theory. This is running code.
