- **Ambitious:** 10 supporters @ $500/month = $5,000 ✓
- **Realistic:** 25 supporters @ $200/month = $5,000 ✓
- **Conservative:** 100 supporters @ $50/month = $5,000 ✓

## ⚡ QUICK WINS (Do These First)

1. **Email 5 people you know WILL say yes**
   - Start with wins to build momentum
   - Even if it's $10/month from a friend
   - Momentum > perfection

2. **Post to r/SideProject TODAY**
   - Highest ROI subreddit for this
   - Takes 10 minutes
   - Could drive 5-10 clicks

3. **Tweet about it TODAY**
   - Your network needs to know
   - Pin it to profile
   - Check back and engage with replies

---

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION FOR TODAY:

**Priority 1:** Email 10 warm contacts (2 hours)
**Priority 2:** Post to r/SideProject (30 min)
**Priority 3:** Tweet about it (15 min)

Total time: ~3 hours
Expected result: 1-3 supporters, $50-300/month

Then iterate daily based on what works.

## 🚀 READY TO EXECUTE?

All content is written. All templates are ready.

You can either:
1. Execute manually (copy/paste templates, send emails, post to Reddit)
2. Have me build automation (email bot, Reddit bot, tracking system)
3. Mix of both (manual for personal, automated for scale)

**What's your preference?**
