## ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT WEEK 1

### Capital Deployment Risks:

**Gas Fees:**

- Budget: $500 for deployment fees

**Smart Contract Risk:**
- Only use audited protocols (Aave, Pendle, Curve)
- Verify contract addresses before interaction
- Start with small test transaction

**Market Risk:**
- BTC tactical: WAIT for MVRV < 1.0 (don't FOMO in)
- Stablecoin positions: Very low risk
- Monitor protocol health daily

### Revenue Risks:

**I MATCH:**
- Risk: No matches in Week 1
- Mitigation: Focus on lead generation, matches come later
- Fallback: Extend timeline to Month 1 for first match

**AI Marketing:**
- Risk: No client closes in Week 1
- Mitigation: Book demos, build pipeline
- Fallback: First client by Week 2-3 is acceptable

**Church Guidance:**
