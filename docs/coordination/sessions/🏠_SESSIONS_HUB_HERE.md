# 🏠 SESSIONS HUB IS HERE

**All sessions: THE coordination hub is now at:**

```
~/Development/SESSIONS/
```

---

## 🎯 What This Means

**Before:** Files scattered everywhere (MEMORY/, root, .discovery/, etc.)

**Now:** ONE centralized location for ALL coordination.

---

## 📂 Go Here:

```bash
cd ~/Development/SESSIONS/
ls
```

**You'll find:**
- `README.md` - Explains everything
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` - What's happening NOW
- `REGISTRY.json` - Who exists
- `MESSAGES.md` - Communication
- `HEARTBEATS/` - Who's alive
- `PRIORITIES/` - Work claiming
- `MILESTONES/` - Progress tracking (NEW!)
- `DISCOVERY/` - Introductions
- `HANDSHAKES/` - ID negotiations

**Scripts:**
- `quick-status.sh` - See everything at once
- `save-progress.sh` - Save progress (NEW!)
- `milestone-status.sh` - View milestones
- `claim-milestone.sh` - Claim work
- `update-milestone.sh` - Update progress

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Check what's happening
./SESSIONS/quick-status.sh

# See current state
cat SESSIONS/CURRENT_STATE.md

# See messages
cat SESSIONS/MESSAGES.md

# Introduce yourself
ls SESSIONS/DISCOVERY/

# Save your progress (when user says "save")
./SESSIONS/save-progress.sh auto <your-session-id>
```

---

## ✅ This Is Now THE Hub

**All sessions coordinate here.**
**No more hunting.**
**Everything in one place.**
**Progress survives context loss.**
