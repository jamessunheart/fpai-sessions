## 🛠️ Implementation

### **Step 1: Define Membership Offerings**

Create landing pages for each tier:

**Basic Tier Landing Page:**
- Headline: "Join White Rock Ministry - Transform Your Financial Future"
- Benefits: Trust guidance, AI tools, wallet optimization
- Price: $2,500 one-time
- CTA: "Join Basic Membership"

**Premium/Platinum:** Similar structure with added benefits

### **Step 2: Member Onboarding Process**

```
1. Member signs PMA agreement
2. Pays membership fee ($2,500-$15,000)
3. Receives access to:
   - Member portal
   - AI compliance tools
   - Trust setup guidance
4. Optional: Connect wallet for optimization
   - If yes → Assets added to AUM
   - Monthly management fees begin
5. Ongoing:
   - Quarterly performance review
   - Token transactions as needed
   - Support and updates
```

### **Step 3: Track Everything in Sacred Loop**

```python
from white_rock_ministry_model import WhiteRockMinistry

ministry = WhiteRockMinistry()

# New member joins
ministry.add_member(
    name="John Smith",
    email="john@example.com",
    tier="premium",  # $7,500
    initial_assets=250000,  # $250K AUM
    notes="Referral from existing member"
)

# This automatically:
# - Logs $7,500 membership revenue
# - Allocates 40% ministry, 60% optimization
# - Adds $250K to AUM
# - Queues monthly management fee calculation

# Each month:
ministry.calculate_monthly_fees()
# Charges 2%/12 = 0.167% on all AUM

# Each quarter:
ministry.log_performance_fee(
    member_id="WRM_...",
    gains=37500,  # 15% on $250K
    benchmark_gains=12500  # 5% benchmark
)
# Charges 20% on $25K excess = $5K fee
```

## ⚖️ Legal Compliance

### **Your Structure:**
✅ **White Rock Ministry = 508(c)(1)(A) church**
- Exempt from IRS registration (First Amendment right)
- Operates as religious organization
- Provides member services within religious mission

✅ **Private Membership Association (PMA)**
- Members join voluntarily via agreement
- Services provided to members only
- Protected from outside regulation
- Private contracts between consenting adults

✅ **Internal Token = Utility, Not Security**
- Used only within PMA
- Not traded publicly
- Facilitates inter-trust transfers
- No expectation of profit from others' efforts
- Utility function (not investment)

✅ **Treasury Optimization = Member Benefit**

- Not offered to general public
- Part of membership package
- Governed by PMA agreement

### **What to Avoid:**
❌ Don't call it "investment advice" (it's a PMA service)
❌ Don't market to general public (PMA is private)
❌ Don't promise specific returns (provide projections only)
❌ Don't trade token outside PMA (internal use only)
