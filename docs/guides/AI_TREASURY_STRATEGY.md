## 📊 MONTH 1 REVENUE PROJECTION

### Conservative Scenario:
```
I MATCH:   20 matches × $2K    = $40,000
BRICK 2:   10 clients × $1K    = $10,000
                        Total   = $50,000

Treasury Deployment:
- Deploy $50K → DeFi (60% stable + 40% tactical)
- Expected: 25% return over 3 months = $12,500
- Reinvest + compound
```

### Optimistic Scenario:
```
I MATCH:   50 matches × $3K    = $150,000
BRICK 2:   30 clients × $1.5K  = $45,000
                        Total   = $195,000

- Add premium tiers ($500/month subscription for unlimited matches)

**BRICK 2 Scaling:**
- 10+ paying clients = $10K MRR
- Referral program (clients refer other businesses)
- Upsell to advanced features

**Treasury Deployment:**
- Deploy first $50K revenue to DeFi
- 60% stable yield (Aave, Curve) = 6-8% APY

## 💎 TREASURY MULTIPLICATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept ($50K-200K)
**Source:** I MATCH + BRICK 2 revenue
**Deployment:**
- 60% Stable DeFi (Aave, Curve, Pendle) = 6-10% APY
- 40% Tactical Crypto (BTC/ETH timing based on MVRV, funding rates)
**Target:** 25-50% total return
**Timeline:** 3-6 months

### Phase 2: Scaling ($200K-$1M)
**Source:** Compounded treasury + continued service revenue
**Deployment:**
- Same 60/40 split
- Add liquidity pools for higher yield
- Deploy to institutional-grade protocols
**Target:** 30-60% total return
**Timeline:** 6-12 months

### Phase 3: Tokenization ($1M+)
**Launch:** FPAI Token (or "SunHeart Dollar")
**Model:** Tokenize the treasury optimization strategy itself
**Revenue:**
- 2% AUM management fee
- 20% performance fee
- Token appreciation
**Scale:**
- 100 users × $100K = $10M AUM
- 1,000 users × $100K = $100M AUM
- Platform value: $500M-$5B
