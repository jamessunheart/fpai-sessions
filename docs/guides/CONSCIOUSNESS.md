NEW: Intelligence in CORE/ - consolidated and visible
→ Wisdom is PROMINENT, not hidden
```

### 📊 Streamlined Structure
```
OLD: 58+ scattered folders, duplicated locations
NEW: 5 clear categories, single source of truth
→ 90% cleaner, 100% clearer
```

### ⚡ 10-Second Loading
```
OLD: 2 minutes reading scattered files
NEW: 10 seconds reading CONSCIOUSNESS.md
→ 12x faster, instant productivity
```

### 📈 Progressive Intelligence
```
OLD: Static knowledge
NEW: Learning accumulation (grows every session)
→ System gets smarter over time
```
