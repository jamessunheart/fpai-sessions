**Update Weekly:** Track progress, record MVRV, note actions taken

---

### Calendar Events:

**Add to Calendar:**

**1. Quarterly Options Expiries (Most Important)**
- **December 27, 2025** ← NEXT (6 weeks!)
- March 28, 2026
- June 26, 2026
- September 25, 2026

**For Each Expiry:**
- Set reminder: 7 days before (Dec 20 for next one)
- Action: Research max pain, funding rates, prepare tactical play

**2. Monthly Review**
- Last day of each month
- 2-hour review: performance, rebalancing, lessons

**3. Peak Watch Period**
- February-March 2026
- Daily MVRV checks during this window
- Be ready to sell as MVRV climbs >3.5

---

## 🎯 PHASE 6: ONGOING MANAGEMENT

### Daily Routine (5 minutes):

**Morning Check (Before Coffee):**
1. Open MVRV Z-Score chart → Note current value
2. Check funding rates → Extreme positive/negative?
3. Glance at Fear & Greed → Extreme readings?
4. Check BTC/ETH prices → Any major moves?
5. Update spreadsheet if significant change

**Action Required Only If:**
- MVRV crosses threshold (3.5, 5, 7)
- Funding rates extreme for 3+ days
- Quarterly expiry approaching (7-day window)
- Otherwise: No action, let it run

---

### Weekly Review (30 minutes):

**Sunday Evening (Recommended):**
1. Update tracking spreadsheet with current values
2. Calculate unrealized gains on BTC/ETH
3. Check if base yield protocols need harvesting
4. Review upcoming calendar events
5. Read crypto news for major developments
6. Adjust strategy if market dynamics change

**Questions to Ask:**
- Are we on track for peak predictions?
- Any protocol issues (hacks, exploits)?
- Do allocation percentages need rebalancing?

---

### Monthly Deep-Dive (2 hours):

**Last Day of Month:**

**1. Performance Analysis**
- Calculate total portfolio value
- Compare to benchmarks (BTC, static yield)
- Calculate actual returns vs predictions

**2. Indicator Review**
- Has MVRV been accurate?
- Did funding rates predict moves?
- Any false signals?

**3. Rebalancing (If Needed)**
- If BTC/ETH allocation drifts >5%, consider rebalancing
  - Example: BTC pumps, now 50% of portfolio instead of 40%
  - Option: Sell some BTC, move to yield (de-risk)

**4. Learning Capture**
- What worked? What didn't?
- Document for future cycles
- Refine strategy

---

## 🎯 DECEMBER 27 QUARTERLY EXPIRY (Next Big Opportunity)

### Preparation Timeline:

**Dec 20 (7 Days Before - Start Research):**

**1. Check Max Pain Level**
- Go to: deribit.com/statistics (or other options analytics)
- Find: Dec 27 BTC/ETH expiry data
- Note: Max pain price level
  - **Max pain** = price where most option buyers lose most money
  - **Theory:** Price tends to gravitate toward max pain before expiry

**2. Monitor Funding Rates**
- coinglass.com/fundingrate
- Check: BTC and ETH perpetual funding
- **Interpretation:**
  - Positive funding (longs paying shorts) + max pain below current price → Likely move down
  - Negative funding (shorts paying longs) + max pain above current price → Likely move up

**3. Assess Sentiment**
- Fear & Greed Index → Extreme readings?
- Twitter/Reddit sentiment → Overly bullish/bearish?
- **Contrarian approach:** Fade extreme sentiment

---

**Dec 23-26 (Execution Window):**

**Example Scenario (Hypothetical):**
- Current BTC: $105,000
- Max pain: $110,000
- Funding rate: +0.15% (positive, longs paying)
- Fear & Greed: 80 (Greed)

**Analysis:**
- Max pain above current price → Upward bias
- Positive funding → Overcrowded longs (caution)
- High greed → Potential for reversal

**Possible Play:**
- Deploy $80K long position targeting $110K max pain
- Set stop loss at $100K (-5% max loss)
- Target exit: $108-110K range (24-48 hours before expiry)
- Expected gain: 5-7% = $4,000-$5,600

**Or:**
- If signals conflict, skip the trade
- Not every expiry is a clear opportunity
- Only trade when conviction high

---

**Dec 27-28 (Expiry + Exit):**

**Day of Expiry:**
- Monitor price action closely
- Volume typically spikes 150-200%
- Volatility increases 18-25%

**Exit Strategy:**
- Close position 24-48 hours after expiry
- Don't try to catch the exact top
- Bank profits, return capital to base yield
- **Or:** If BTC still bullish, keep in spot allocation

---

### Expected Outcomes:

**Success Case:**
- Gain 10-20% on $80K = $8,000-$16,000
- Close position, profits to stablecoins
- Compound into next opportunity (March expiry)

**Neutral Case:**
- Price doesn't reach max pain, small gain/loss
- -2% to +5% = -$1,600 to +$4,000
- Close position, minimal impact

**Risk Case:**
- Signals wrong, stop loss triggered
- -5% = -$4,000 loss
- Acceptable: 1% of total portfolio
- Learn and refine for next time

**Key:** Only play when signals align. Don't force trades.

- ALWAYS send test transaction first ($100)
- ALWAYS triple-check addresses
- Use whitelists on exchanges (can't withdraw to new addresses without delay)
- Enable 2FA everywhere
- Use unique strong passwords (password manager)

**3. Scam Awareness**
- No one legitimate will DM you offering "help"
- Ledger/Trezor only from official websites
- MetaMask only from metamask.io
- Beware fake support impersonators

---

### Tax Considerations:

**1. Track Everything**
- Every trade is taxable event
- Keep records: entry prices, exit prices, dates
- Use CoinTracker or similar for automated tracking

**2. Gains vs Income**
- DeFi yield = ordinary income (taxed at income rate)
- BTC/ETH gains = capital gains (long-term if >1 year)

**3. Set Aside for Taxes**
- Keep 20-30% of realized gains for taxes
- Don't spend all profits, IRS wants their cut

**4. Consider Professional Help**
- $400K portfolio → Worth hiring crypto tax specialist
- Cost: $1,000-3,000 for tax prep
- Saves headaches and potential audit issues

---

### Emotional Discipline:

**1. Stick to the Plan**
- MVRV >7 = SELL (even if everyone says "this time is different")
- Don't get greedy trying to catch exact top
- Plan the trade, trade the plan

**2. Don't Panic on Dips**
- -20-30% corrections normal in bull market
- Check MVRV - if still <3, it's a dip not a top
- Have conviction in the data

**3. Avoid FOMO**
- Don't chase pumps
- Stick to allocation percentages
- Other coins pump harder but also dump harder

**4. Sleep Well**
- If position size stresses you out, reduce it
- Better to earn 20% and sleep than 40% with anxiety
- 60% base yield ensures stability

## 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE: EXIT STRATEGY

### Scale Out As MVRV Climbs:

**MVRV 2-3 (Current):**
- Hold 100% tactical allocation
- Accumulate on dips
- Let it run

**MVRV 3-3.5:**
- Start watching closely
- Prepare to sell first tranche
- Action: Sell 25% of BTC/ETH
  - 0.816 BTC × 25% = 0.204 BTC sell
  - 21 ETH × 25% = 5.25 ETH sell
- Move proceeds to stablecoins/yield

**MVRV 4-5:**
- Late cycle, euphoria building
- Action: Sell 50% of remaining (37.5% total)
  - Remaining: 0.612 BTC → Sell 0.306 BTC
  - Remaining: 15.75 ETH → Sell 7.87 ETH
- Keep 37.5% for potential blow-off top

**MVRV 6-7:**
- Top zone, extreme greed likely
- Action: Sell 67% of remaining (62% total sold)
  - Remaining: 0.306 BTC → Sell 0.204 BTC
  - Remaining: 7.87 ETH → Sell 5.25 ETH
- Keep 12.5% for final run

**MVRV 7-9:**
- Historical cycle tops
- Action: EXIT 100% remaining
  - Sell final 0.102 BTC
  - Sell final 2.62 ETH
- Move to 100% stablecoins

**Post-Top (MVRV crashes, -30%+ from peak):**
- Confirmed bear market
- 100% in stablecoins earning yield
- Wait for MVRV <1 to re-accumulate

---

### Example Scenario:

**Starting Position:**
- 0.816 BTC @ $98K entry = $80,000
- 21 ETH @ $3,800 entry = $80,000

**Exit Prices (Hypothetical):**
- MVRV 3.5: BTC $150K, ETH $7K → Sell 25%
- MVRV 5: BTC $200K, ETH $9K → Sell 50% remaining
- MVRV 7: BTC $250K, ETH $11K → Sell 67% remaining
- MVRV 9: BTC $280K, ETH $12K → Exit 100%

**Gains Calculation:**
```
BTC Sales:
0.204 BTC @ $150K = $30,600 (cost: $20K, gain: $10.6K)
0.306 BTC @ $200K = $61,200 (cost: $30K, gain: $31.2K)
0.204 BTC @ $250K = $51,000 (cost: $20K, gain: $31K)
0.102 BTC @ $280K = $28,560 (cost: $10K, gain: $18.56K)
Total BTC Gain: $91,360 (114% return)

ETH Sales:
5.25 ETH @ $7K = $36,750 (cost: $20K, gain: $16.75K)
7.87 ETH @ $9K = $70,830 (cost: $30K, gain: $40.83K)
5.25 ETH @ $11K = $57,750 (cost: $20K, gain: $37.75K)
2.62 ETH @ $12K = $31,440 (cost: $10K, gain: $21.44K)
Total ETH Gain: $116,770 (146% return)

Combined: $208,130 total gain on $160K (130% return)
```

**This is why scaling out works:** Capture most of the gains, avoid the crash.
