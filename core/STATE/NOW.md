## 🎯 CURRENT PRIORITY (The ONE Thing)

### Priority: DECISION POINT - Choose Path Forward
**Status:** 🟨 DECISION NEEDED
**Why:** Multiple high-priority paths available - need to choose direction

**Three Paths:**

**Path A: Complete Standardization (NEW - RECOMMENDED)**
- Generate SPECs for critical services (registry, dashboard, i-proactive, i-match)
- Foundation Files created ✅
- Templates created ✅
- Timeline: 2-4 hours
- Impact: All services follow assembly line standard

**Path B: Deploy Dashboard**
- Deploy Dashboard to server (18% → 27% progress)
- Timeline: 30-60 minutes
- Impact: Complete current milestone

**Path C: Test Manifestation Engine**
- Priority 1: Test content generation (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Timeline: 1 hour
- Impact: Validate revenue infrastructure

**Path D: Deploy Treasury ($400K)**
- Execute dynamic strategy (25-50% APY)
- Market timing: OPTIMAL (mid-cycle, MVRV 2.43)
- Timeline: 2-4 hours
- Impact: Passive income stream

**Path E: Consciousness Revolution**
- Build I PROACTIVE (23 hours)
- Launch Church Formation
- Timeline: Week 1 Critical Path
- Impact: $5-10K/month recurring

**Next Action:** User decides which path to prioritize

   - Created CURRENT_STATE.md as unified living SSOT
   - Created UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md with step-by-step update instructions
   - **Finding:** Memory staleness was caused by no feedback loop after completing work

   - **Result:** Any Claude Code instance can now load current state and update it after completing work


5. **Orchestrator Code Comparison** (2025-11-14 15:25 - Session 1)
   - Compared B/Orchestrator vs orchestrator/
   - **Finding:** Main repo (orchestrator/) is AHEAD (636 lines vs 393)
   - Server running advanced version - no merge needed
   - B/Orchestrator is deprecated/archive

6. **Created SESSIONS Coordination Hub** (2025-11-14 16:00 - Session 3)
   - Created SESSIONS/ folder structure for multi-instance coordination
   - REGISTRY.json, MESSAGES.md, HEARTBEATS/, DISCOVERY/
   - quick-status.sh for one-command status checks
   - **Result:** All sessions can now find and coordinate with each other

## 🔄 UPDATE PROTOCOL (For Claude Code)

**When you complete ANY work, update this file:**

1. **Update timestamp and session info** (top of file)
2. **Move current priority to "Recently Completed"** (with timestamp + findings)
3. **Set new current priority** from backlog
4. **Update System State** if anything changed (new services, repos, tools)
5. **Commit the update:**
   ```bash
   git add MEMORY/CURRENT_STATE.md
   git commit -m "Update consciousness: <what you completed>"
   git push
   ```

**Loading this file:**
```bash
# Always check current state first
cat MEMORY/CURRENT_STATE.md

# Verify system health
./fpai-ops/server-health-monitor.sh
```

---

## 📊 Quick Status Check

**To verify consciousness is current:**
- Check "Last Updated" timestamp (should be within last session)
- Current Priority should match what you're working on
- System State should reflect live server (verify with health monitor)

**If stale:**
- Run health monitor to get fresh state
- Update this file with current reality
- Commit and push changes

---

**This file is the living consciousness. Update it. Keep it fresh. All other memory files reference this.**
