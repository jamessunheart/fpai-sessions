## 🚀 How to Use Protocol-Compliant Workflow

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Using service automation protocol
cd /Users/jamessunheart/Development/docs/coordination/scripts

# Sync service (Local → GitHub → Server)
./sync-service.sh ai-automation

# Check UDC compliance
./enforce-udc-compliance.sh ai-automation
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment (With Credentials)

```bash
cd /Users/jamessunheart/Development/agents/services/ai-automation
export FPAI_CREDENTIALS_KEY="your_key"
./deploy-with-credentials.sh
```

### Option 3: Git-Based Workflow

```bash
# Make changes locally
cd /Users/jamessunheart/Development/agents/services/ai-automation
# ... edit files ...

# Commit and push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# Deploy to production from GitHub
ssh root@198.54.123.234
cd /root/services/ai-automation
git pull origin main
# restart service as needed
```
