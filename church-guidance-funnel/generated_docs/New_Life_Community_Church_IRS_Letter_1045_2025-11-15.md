Dear Internal Revenue Service,

RE: Notification of Tax-Exempt Status under IRC Section 508(c)(1)(A) for New Life Community Church

This letter is to inform the Internal Revenue Service that New Life Community Church, located in the state of TX, is claiming automatic tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 508(c)(1)(A) as a church.

As a church, New Life Community Church is not required to apply for tax-exempt status with the IRS. Our core beliefs include the belief in the Bible as the inspired Word of God, salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, the importance of worship and prayer, and serving our community with love. Our activities include regular worship services, bible study, prayer meetings, and community outreach.

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects the free exercise of religion, and churches like New Life Community Church are automatically recognized as tax-exempt organizations without the need to file for recognition of exemption.

This notification is being provided for record-keeping purposes. We understand that churches under 508(c)(1)(A) are not required to apply for tax-exempt status, but we are choosing to do so to ensure our status is properly documented.

Sincerely,

[Authorized Representative]
New Life Community Church
