**Timeline:** 7 days to first revenue
**Capital Required:** $0
**Expected Monthly:** $5K-40K

**Infrastructure:**

**Current Problem:**
- Leveraged positions = NEGATIVE carry
- Funding fees bleeding capital daily
- Zero yield being generated
- Opportunity cost: $7,125/month

**Solution - DeFi Deployment:**
```
Asset Allocation:

        • 7-8% APY
        • Highly liquid
        • Auto-compounding
        • Risk: Very low

$100K → Pendle Yield Trading (PT-stETH, PT-GLP)
        • 15-25% APY
        • Fixed yield exposure
        • Liquid secondary market
        • Risk: Low-medium

        • Risk: Very low

$53K  → Active DeFi (Jito, Kamino, opportunities)

$140K @ 7.5%  = $10,500/year
$100K @ 20%   = $20,000/year
$80K  @ 10%   = $8,000/year
$53K  @ 15%   = $7,950/year
────────────────────────
TOTAL         = $46,450/year ($3,871/month)
```

7. Remaining $53K to active DeFi rotation

**6-Month Projection:**
- Yield earned: $23,225
