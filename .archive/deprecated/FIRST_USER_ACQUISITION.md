# FIRST USER ACQUISITION PLAN

## Current Reality:
- 0 real customers
- 0 real providers (all are your services)
- Platform is 100% functional
- Human Participation System is LIVE
- **Bottleneck: NO TRAFFIC**

## Highest Leverage Action:

**Post I MATCH to Reddit communities where people are ACTIVELY LOOKING for:**
1. Financial advisors
2. Executive coaches
3. Church formation help
4. AI development services

## Reddit Strategy:

### Target Subreddits:

**Financial Advisors (Highest Volume):**
- r/personalfinance (18M members) - "How do I find a financial advisor?"
- r/financialindependence (2.1M members) - People with money to invest
- r/Fire (1M members) - Early retirees needing advisors
- r/investing (2.6M members) - Active investor community

**Executive Coaching:**
- r/entrepreneur (4M members) - Business owners needing coaching
- r/startups (1.8M members) - Founders needing guidance
- r/smallbusiness (2.5M members) - SMB owners

**Church Formation:**
- r/Christianity (400K members) - Ministry leaders
- r/Reformed (100K members) - Theological community
- r/TrueChristian (200K members) - Active believers

### Content Strategy:

**Use the contribution system's pre-written content:**
- Authentic testimonial format
- Focuses on PROBLEM (hard to find good advisor)
- Shows SOLUTION (AI matching)
- FREE for customers (key selling point)
- Beta scarcity (limited spots)

### Execution Plan:

**Phase 1: Comment on existing posts (Today)**
- Search r/personalfinance for "financial advisor" posts from last 24h
- Provide genuine helpful response + mention I MATCH
- Target: 10 comments today

**Phase 2: Make original posts (Tomorrow)**
- Use contribution system's Reddit content
- Post to r/personalfinance, r/financialindependence
- Monitor responses

**Phase 3: Activate viral loop (Week 1)**
- First real customer signs up
- They get matched
- Show them contribution system
- They share and earn POT
- VIRAL LOOP ACTIVATED

## Success Metrics:

**Day 1:** 1 real customer sign-up
**Week 1:** 5 real customers, 2 providers
**Month 1:** 10 matches (Phase 1 goal)

## Critical Path:

Traffic → Sign-ups → Matches → Satisfied customers → Viral sharing → Exponential growth

The platform is ready. The contribution system is ready.
We just need the FIRST real user to light the fuse.

**Starting with Reddit comments NOW.**
