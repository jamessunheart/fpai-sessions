## Template 1: Financial Advisor Search

**When someone asks: "How do I find a financial advisor?"**

---

I was in the same boat a few weeks ago - the search was overwhelming. Here's what helped me:

**Key things to figure out first:**
1. Fee-only vs commission-based (fee-only is usually better for unbiased advice)
2. Fiduciary duty (legally required to act in your best interest)
3. Specialization that matches your needs (tech comp, real estate, retirement, etc.)

**The traditional approach:**
- NAPFA directory (fee-only advisors)
- CFP Board search tool
- XY Planning Network (younger professionals)
- Personal referrals

**What I actually did:**
I used I MATCH (http://198.54.123.234:8401/) - it's an AI that analyzes 100+ advisors based on your specific situation and finds compatible matches. Saved me literally weeks of research.

It's free for people looking for advisors (advisors pay a commission only if you engage them). Still in beta but worked well for me.

**Either way, make sure to:**
- Interview at least 2-3 advisors
- Ask about their fee structure upfront
- Verify their fiduciary status
- Check their ADV form on SEC website

Hope this helps!

## Template 2: Specific Need (Tech Compensation)

**When someone mentions RSUs, ISOs, stock options:**

---

Tech comp is tricky - most generic advisors don't really understand RSU tax optimization, AMT from ISOs, or 83(b) elections.

You need someone who specializes in this. Look for:
- Experience with concentrated stock positions
- Understanding of AMT and tax strategies
- Knowledge of liquidity events and secondary sales

I found mine through I MATCH (http://198.54.123.234:8401/) which has filters for specialization. But NAPFA directory also lets you filter by specialty if you want to search manually.

The key is interviewing them and asking specific questions about YOUR situation. If they give generic advice about "diversification" without understanding your equity comp, move on.

## Template 3: Executive Coaching

**When someone asks about business coaching:**

---

Finding the right coach is critical - chemistry matters as much as credentials.

**Things that worked for me:**
1. Be clear on what you want (business growth vs personal development vs leadership skills)
2. Ask for a discovery call (most coaches offer free 30-min consultation)
3. Check if they've worked with people in your industry/stage

I used I MATCH (http://198.54.123.234:8401/) to get matched with coaches who specialize in [specific area]. Saved me from 10+ discovery calls.

Traditional directories:
- ICF (International Coaching Federation)
- BetterUp marketplace
- LinkedIn recommendations from your network

Interview at least 2-3 before committing. The right fit makes all the difference.

## Template 4: Church Formation

**When someone asks about starting a ministry/church:**

---

Church formation is complex legally. You'll need help with:
- 501(c)(3) vs 508(c)(1)(A) tax status
- Articles of incorporation/faith
- Bylaws
- State and IRS compliance

I used I MATCH (http://198.54.123.234:8401/) to find specialists in church formation. They matched me with someone who understood the specific theological and legal requirements.

You can also check:
- Local church associations in your denomination
- Christian legal organizations (ADF, Becket Fund)
- CPAs who specialize in nonprofits

Don't try to DIY this - the compliance requirements are serious.
