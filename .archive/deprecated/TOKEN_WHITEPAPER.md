2. **AI Agent Revenue** - Services generating real cash flow
3. **Buyback & Burn** - Revenue used to reduce supply
4. **Governance Rights** - Control over treasury and agents

**Token holders own a share of an autonomous AI empire that grows 24/7.**

## 💎 Token Value Drivers

### **1. Treasury Backing (Floor Price)**

```
Floor Price = Treasury Value / Circulating Supply

Example:
Treasury: $500,000
Circulating: 100M tokens
Floor: $0.005/token

As treasury grows, floor rises.
```

### **2. Yield Distribution**

```
Treasury Yield: 35% APY
Distributed: 50% to token holders
Effective Yield: 17.5% APY for holders

Example:
Hold: 10,000 FPAI
Share: 0.01% of supply
Annual Yield: $875 (if $500K treasury)
```

### **3. Buyback & Burn**

```
Service Revenue: $100K/month
Buyback Amount: 25% = $25K/month
Annual Buyback: $300K

Effect:
- Reduces circulating supply
- Increases scarcity
- Supports price
```

### **4. Governance Premium**

```
Token holders vote on:
- Treasury allocation strategy
- Agent priority & development
- Revenue distribution
- Parameter changes

Governance value: 10-30% premium
```
