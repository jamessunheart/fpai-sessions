### TITLE (copy this):
```
Running an experiment: Can AI match you to a financial advisor better than Google?
```

### BODY (copy this):
```
**Full transparency: This is an experiment**

**The problem I noticed:**
My dad's a CFP. He gets low-quality leads from generic services.
Meanwhile, clients struggle to find advisors who understand their specific situation.

**The experiment:**
I built an AI matching system (using Claude) to see if AI can analyze compatibility
better than traditional search. Testing if it actually works.

**Current status:**
- Just launched (zero customers so far)
- Infrastructure is built, matching engine is ready
- Genuinely don't know if this is better or just noise

**How it works:**
- You describe your needs (RSUs, ISOs, tax optimization, estate planning, etc.)
- AI analyzes 100+ advisor profiles
- Matches based on specialization, values, communication style
- Free for customers (advisors pay only if you engage)

**What I'm testing:**
1. Can AI understand human compatibility well enough?
2. Will people trust AI recommendations for something this important?
3. Is this actually better than Googling "financial advisor near me"?

**Honest ask:**
If you're interested in helping test this (and getting matched for free),
comment or DM. Even if it doesn't work for you, your feedback helps.

Will report back in 30 days whether this was useful or just another dead end.

P.S. - Yes, Claude AI helped me write this post. We're experimenting with
how to communicate honestly about AI-powered tools.

**Edit:** Responding to everyone who comments. Please allow 24 hours for matches.
And seriously - if it sucks, tell me. That's valuable data too.
