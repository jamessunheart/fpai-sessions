TITLE:
Tested: Can AI match me to a financial advisor better than Google?

BODY:
I just tried an experiment: AI-powered financial advisor matching.

Background: My dad's a CFP. I grew up around this industry. Always thought finding an advisor was more like dating than hiring.

The problem: Google gives you the same results everyone else gets. Doesn't understand compatibility.

The experiment: I MATCH - AI that asks about your values, communication style, and goals, then matches you to advisors based on actual compatibility (not just AUM or certifications).

Status: Super early. Might work, might not. Free to try.

What I learned: The AI picked up on things I didn't know I cared about (like "I want someone who challenges my assumptions" vs "I want someone who validates my decisions").

Curious if others have tried AI matching for professional services. Does compatibility even matter for financial advice?
