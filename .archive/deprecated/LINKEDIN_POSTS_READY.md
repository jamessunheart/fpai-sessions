## POST #1: Personal Story (High Engagement)

**When to Post:** Morning (7-9am) on Tuesday or Wednesday

```
I just spent 6 months building an AI that matches people to financial advisors.

My dad's a CFP. I grew up around this industry. And I've realized something:

Finding the right financial advisor is more like dating than hiring.

You can have two advisors with identical credentials, similar fees, comparable track records—and one is perfect for you while the other is terrible.

Why? Compatibility.

Communication style. Risk philosophy. How they think about money vs. how you think about money.

So I built an AI experiment (with Claude) to test if we can match on compatibility, not just credentials.

Currently: Zero customers. Just launched.
Success rate: Unknown (that's what we're testing).
Could fail completely: Absolutely possible.

But the hypothesis is interesting: Can AI understand human compatibility well enough to make meaningful matches?

No idea. Let's find out.

Link in comments to try it (free, 5 minutes, totally experimental).

Honest disclaimer: Very early stage. Might work, might not.

**Why this works:**
- Personal story (dad is CFP)
- Honest about stage (zero customers)
- Clear hypothesis (compatibility > credentials)
- Vulnerable (could fail)
- Call to action in comments

## POST #2: Insight/Value (Thought Leadership)

**When to Post:** Midweek afternoon (1-3pm)

```
The question most people never ask when choosing a financial advisor:

"How do you handle it when we disagree on investment strategy?"

Here's why it matters:

Good advisors guide. They don't dictate.

If someone can't articulate how they handle disagreement, that's a massive red flag. It means either:
(a) They expect you to follow blindly
(b) They've never thought about collaborative relationships
(c) They don't actually respect client autonomy

The best answer I've heard? "We'd discuss why we see it differently, I'd share my concerns with data, but ultimately it's your money and your risk tolerance. My job is to inform, not control."

That's the kind of advisor worth keeping.

P.S. I built an AI matching system that tries to evaluate compatibility like this. Super experimental. Zero customers so far. Testing if AI can actually understand these nuances.

Curious if others think this approach matters or if I'm overthinking it.

**Why this works:**
- Leads with value (actionable insight)
- Not selling, teaching
- P.S. mentions AI system (soft CTA)
- Invites discussion

## POST #3: Behind the Scenes (Authenticity)

**When to Post:** Friday afternoon (builds weekend engagement)

```
Honest update on my AI financial advisor matching experiment:

Week 1 Status:
✅ Service is live
✅ Landing page deployed
✅ AI matching algorithm working
❌ Customers: Still zero
❌ Revenue: $0

What I learned this week:

1. Building the tech was the easy part. Getting people to try something new is hard.

2. "AI matching" sounds cool but also kinda scary. Need better messaging.

3. Most people don't realize how much compatibility matters when choosing an advisor. That's a framing problem.

4. My hypothesis might be wrong. The market might not care about deep compatibility matching. That's okay—that's what experiments are for.

Next week:
- Test Reddit outreach (r/personalfinance)
- Write guide: "5 Questions to Ask Before Choosing a Financial Advisor"
- Get 10 brave early testers

If you're thinking "this guy is way too transparent about his lack of traction"—yeah, probably. But I'd rather build in public and learn fast than pretend everything's going great.

Anyone brave enough to be an early tester? Link in comments.

## POST #4: Question/Poll (High Engagement)

**When to Post:** Monday or Tuesday morning (starts conversations)

```
Quick poll for anyone who's hired a financial advisor:

What mattered MOST in your decision?

A) Credentials (CFP, CFA, etc.)
B) Fees/cost structure
C) Performance track record
D) "I just got a good vibe from them"

Genuinely curious because I'm testing a hypothesis:

I think "D" (compatibility/vibe) matters WAY more than we admit, but most matching services focus on A, B, C.

So I built an AI experiment that tries to match on compatibility first, credentials second.

Results so far: Zero customers, so maybe I'm totally wrong 😅

But I'm curious what actual humans think.

Vote in comments: A, B, C, or D?

**Why this works:**
- Interactive (polls get engagement)
- Validates hypothesis publicly
- Self-deprecating (zero customers)
- Gets real market feedback

## POST #5: Industry Insight (Value for Advisors)

**When to Post:** Thursday morning (advisors active midweek)

```
For financial advisors:

The cost to acquire a client through traditional lead gen is $1,000-$3,000.

The close rate is 5-15%.

And the biggest problem? Most leads are a terrible fit.

So advisors waste time on consultations with people who:
- Can't afford their services
- Want a totally different approach
- Just don't vibe with their style

What if you could get pre-matched leads who are actually compatible?

That's what I'm testing with an AI matching experiment.

Theory: If AI does the compatibility filtering upfront, advisors get higher-quality leads, and clients get better matches.

Status: Very early. Zero revenue. Literally recruiting first 10 advisors now.

But the unit economics could work:
- Client fills out deep compatibility profile (free)
- AI matches to 1-3 compatible advisors
- Advisors pay commission only on successful matches
- Everyone wins if matches are genuinely better

Could totally fail. But if it works, it changes the economics for everyone.

San Francisco advisors: Want to be in the first cohort? DM me.

P.S. Built this with Claude AI. Very transparent about the experimental nature.

- Shows business model
- Recruiting advisors publicly
- Honest about stage
