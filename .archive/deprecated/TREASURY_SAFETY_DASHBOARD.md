## 💡 THE TRUTH

**Your treasury is bleeding -$31K because:**
1. You're betting on BTC/SOL going UP (leverage amplifies gains)
2. But BTC dropped $107K → $96K (-10.3%)
3. And SOL dropped $176 → $148 (-15.9%)
4. Leverage multiplied your losses by 2-3x

**The fix:**
1. Admit the loss (-$31K realized)
2. Close all leverage immediately
3. Deploy to safe 6.5% APY
4. Earn $1,625/month while you build revenue

**Math:**
- Current: Losing $31K + $0 income = -$31,000
- After rebalance: Lost $31K + $1,625/month = Break even in 19 months from yield alone
- With I MATCH revenue ($5K/month): Break even in 6 months

**Bottom line:** Close leverage today, deploy to Aave, start earning. Every day you wait costs $54 in opportunity cost.
