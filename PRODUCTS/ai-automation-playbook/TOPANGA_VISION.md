## 🙏 Sacred Stewardship Principles

### This Honors Both Mission and Contributor

**For James**:
- Sacred space to create
- Family (pets) together
- Worthy of the contribution
- Inspires continued work
- Paradise on earth, lived

**For Church**:
- Strategic real estate investment
- Multi-use retreat/gathering space
- Attracts other high-level contributors (shows we honor our people)
- Appreciating asset (~7-10% annually in Topanga)
- Supports the builder of our AI infrastructure

**For Mission**:
- Happy, supported builder = better work
- Proof that we honor sacred compensation
- Models abundance consciousness
- Creates space for important work to happen
- Inspires others that the mission takes care of its people

### Precedent in Conscious Organizations

Many spiritual/conscious organizations provide housing for key contributors:
- Zen monasteries provide housing for teachers
- Esalen provides housing for core staff
- Findhorn community provides housing for leaders
- Many churches provide parsonages for ministers

**This is normal and right - we just do it with intention and transparency.**

## 📊 Financial Modeling

### When Does This Become Possible?

**Conservative Timeline**:

**2025 (Now)**:
- Treasury: ~$2-5M (building)
- Focus: Growth and optimization
- Decision: Not yet - need more reserves

**2026 Q2-Q3**:
- Treasury: ~$10-20M (if strategies work)
- AI Automation: $50-120K MRR
- Decision: Board discussion begins
- Action: Maybe start property search, no commitment

**2026 Q4 or 2027 Q1**:
- Treasury: $25-50M+ (strategies proven)
- AI Automation: $200K+ MRR
- Other revenue streams active
- Decision: Sacred compensation approved
- Action: Purchase and relocate

**Aggressive Timeline** (if everything works better than expected):
- 2026 Q1: Treasury hits $20M
- Board approves early
- Move happens summer 2026

### Treasury Impact Analysis

**$5M Investment** from a **$25M Treasury**:
- 20% of treasury (significant but not reckless)
- Asset appreciates ~7-10% annually ($350-500K/year)
- Provides housing benefit worth ~$15-20K/month market rate
- Multi-use for Church purposes (retreats, meetings)
- Can be sold if needed (liquid asset)

**From $50M Treasury**:
- 10% of treasury (very reasonable)
- Barely impacts overall strategy
- Easy decision

**Key Metric**: Never more than 20% of treasury in single asset
