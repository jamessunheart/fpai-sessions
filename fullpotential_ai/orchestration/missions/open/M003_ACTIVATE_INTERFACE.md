# Mission: Activate Chat Orchestrator & Voice (M003)

- **Priority:** P1 (High - UX Optimization)
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Zainab / Gohar
- **Constitution Principle:** **Autonomy over Dependency** — natural-language control removes friction so the Architect can direct without middle layers.
- **Regenerative Impact:** Conversational interfaces transform the Nervous System into a co-creator, freeing human time for strategy and care work.
- **Objective:**
  1. Deploy Droplet #12 (Chat Orchestrator).
  2. Connect it to the Nervous System (Registry + Orchestrator).
  3. Implement a "Command Interface" that lets the Owner issue natural-language instructions (text/voice) instead of writing code prompts.

## Deliverables
- Droplet #12 registered and reachable via `/chat/api/*`.
- Voice/Text bridge tested end-to-end against live registry.
- UX instructions for Owner documented in `docs/guides/`.

## Notes
- Coordinate with Awareness to ensure safety filters are active.
- Consider reusing the existing mission portal for transcript logging.
