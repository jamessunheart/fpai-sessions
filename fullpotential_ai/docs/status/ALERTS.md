# System Alerts (Town Crier)

This file is append-only. The Conscious Pulse daemon adds entries here whenever
it detects a realization that the team should review.

Example format:

```
### 2025-11-22 01:15 UTC
- Insight: System heavily focused on I MATCH, 14 open loops pending revenue.
- Evidence: /memory/open-loops count = 14; latest reflection missing revenue mention.
- Actions: Audit I MATCH funnel, confirm outreach automation.
```

The daemon will continue writing entries below this header.
