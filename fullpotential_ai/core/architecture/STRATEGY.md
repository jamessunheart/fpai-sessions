# THE RECURSIVE AUTOMATION STRATEGY

*Derived from ASSEMBLY_LINE_SOP.md*

## The Prime Directive
We do not just build features; we build the tools that build the features.

## The Evolutionary Path
1. **Phase 1 (Manual):** Humans act as biological placeholders for future AI agents.
   - *Coordinator (Human)* -> Templates -> *Coordinator Droplet (AI)*
   - *Verifier (Human)* -> Templates -> *Verifier Droplet (AI)*
   - *Apprentice (Human)* -> Templates -> *Builder Droplet (Cursor)*

## The Operational Rule
Every time a human performs a task (Review, Queueing, Deployment), the System must analyze the workflow to eventually automate it into a specialized Droplet.
