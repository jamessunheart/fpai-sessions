# Mission Title (replace me)

> Use this template when drafting missions. Patterned after `docs/library/coordination/missions/MISSIONS_INDEX.md` and `UNIFIED_EMPIRE_COMMAND.md` for consistency.

- **Status:** Open | In-Progress | Done
- **Priority:** Px (P0 highest)
- **Human Role:** e.g., Ops Coordinator, Technical Editor, Growth Partner
- **Linked Specs:** reference any file in `docs/library/coordination/missions/` or `specs/*` that gives context
- **Constitution Principle:** cite the clause from `core/knowledge/CONSTITUTION.md` that this mission advances.
- **Regenerative Impact:** describe how the outcome creates net-new value rather than pure efficiency.

## Objective
Short summary of what success looks like. Tie it to a measurable unlock (revenue, risk reduction, learning) per the patterns in `docs/library/coordination/MEMORY/PRINCIPLES.md`.

## Scope & Files
List every repo path or external system the human must touch. If sensitive credentials are needed, STOP and escalate instead of embedding them here.

## Steps
1. Align with the SOP in `docs/library/coordination/missions/<relevant>.json` if it exists.
2. Provide numbered, testable actions.
3. Include verification commands or screenshots.

## Deliverable
- Bullet list of artifacts the reviewer must attach (git diff, screenshot, log output, portal confirmation, etc.).
- Mention where to log notes inside `missions.md`.

## Review Log
| Date | Reviewer | Notes |
