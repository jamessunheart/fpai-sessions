# Mission Pointer Deprecated

The legacy `DO_THIS_NOW.md` backlog has been retired.

Please use the unified missions dashboard instead:

- `orchestration/missions/missions.md` — single source of truth
- `missions/open/`, `missions/in-progress/`, `missions/done/` — status-specific briefs
- Templates for new missions live under `missions/templates/`

All new mission creation, updates, and reporting should flow through the dashboard.
