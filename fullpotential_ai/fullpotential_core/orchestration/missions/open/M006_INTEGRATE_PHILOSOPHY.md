# Mission: Operationalize Consciousism (M006)

- **Priority:** P1 (Core Alignment)
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Nexus (Droplet #13) / Architect
- **Constitution Principle:** **Consciousness over Computation** — philosophy ingestion must expand awareness beyond raw efficiency.
- **Regenerative Impact:** Missions reviewed against the Constitution will bias toward healing, community funding, and long-term stewardship.
- **Objective:**
  1. Ingest and index every PDF/doc/paper under `/opt/fpai/core/knowledge/` and legacy archives.
  2. Fine-tune or prompt the Orchestrator so that every Mission brief is critiqued against `CONSTITUTION.md` before approval.
  3. Establish a metric: the system must produce regenerative suggestions, not purely efficiency upgrades.

## Deliverables
- Knowledge ingestion job that surfaces philosophical references inside Town Crier / dashboards.
- Constitution-aware mission template + reviewer checklist.
- Weekly summary showing how many missions were nudged toward regenerative outcomes.

## Notes
- Coordinate with Magnet + Storefront teams so revenue plans reflect Consciousism principles.
- Feed learnings back into Nexus (optimizer_loop.py) so optimization == healing.
