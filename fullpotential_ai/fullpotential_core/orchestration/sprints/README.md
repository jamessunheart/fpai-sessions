# Apprentice Sprint System

This directory mirrors `orchestration/missions/` but focuses on apprentice-safe work derived from SPEC documents. It keeps sensitive/internal missions separate from sprint tasks.

## Data Sources
- `specs/_meta/traceability.json` – generated by `orchestration/tools/spec_task_sync.py`
  - `assignment: "sprint"` entries become sprint candidates
  - `assignment: "mission"` stay in the internal mission board

## Workflow
1. **Intake:** Run `./orchestration/tools/spec_task_sync.py` whenever SPECs change. This refreshes traceability.
2. **Queue Generation:** Use `orchestration/sprints/update_queue.py` (planned) or manual curation to convert sprint-type specs into queue files under `orchestration/sprints/queue/`.
3. **Review & Publish:** Apprentice coordinator reviews a queue file, removes sensitive details, and publishes the task in the apprentice portal.
4. **Execution:** Apprentices work from their portal sprint list, referencing only the sanitized specs.
5. **Back-Propagation:** Completed sprints feed back into missions or core code as needed. Update traceability afterward.

## Structure
```
orchestration/sprints/
├── README.md

├── templates/
│   └── sprint_template.md
└── reports/
    └── ... (optional future summaries)
```

## Safety Rules
- Never place tasks that require secrets, privileged server access, or production keys.
- Sprint files must reference sanitized docs/specs only.
- If a spec touches regulated or sensitive data, route it back to `orchestration/missions/`.

Use this folder to keep apprentice coordination lightweight while safeguarding internal operations.
