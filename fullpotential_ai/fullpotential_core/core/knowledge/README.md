# Core Knowledge

This module concentrates system-wide mental models, principles, and decision
frameworks. Detailed research libraries remain under `docs/library`, while this
space tracks living references that product and orchestration teams pull into
day-to-day work.

## Included references
- Consciousness, intent, and state dashboards imported from `core/architecture`
- Strategic and operational guides in `docs/strategy`, `docs/guides`, and `docs/status`
- Spec canon in `specs/` for every active autonomy, coordination, outreach,
  treasury, UDC, and product surface area

Add new briefs or distilled learnings here when they directly influence
architecture or recurring decision playbooks.
