# fullpotential.ai – Research Hub

This folder holds the public-facing assets that explain the **Full Potential AI** operating system, Consciousism research, and the Autonomous Mesh.

## Current State

- `frontend/index.html` — placeholder hero that mirrors the live splash page served from `/opt/fpai/core/applications/website-ai/frontend/index.html`.
- Content sources to ingest next:
  - `fullpotential_core/core/knowledge/CONSTITUTION.md`
  - `fullpotential_core/core/knowledge/PAPERS_INDEX.md`
  - `fullpotential_core/docs/papers/*`

## Next Steps

1. **Narrative upgrade** – replace the static HTML with a lightweight static site (Astro/Vite/Eleventy) that can render excerpts from the Constitution + papers index.  
2. **Research log** – surface the latest consciousness or regenerative insights via a simple JSON feed generated by Nexus.  
3. **Domain routing** – keep `/registry/` and `/orchestrator/` reverse proxies inside the `.ai` Nginx block as we iterate so internal tools remain reachable.

Once the Droplet #15 (Nexus Optimizer) outputs regenerative suggestions, we can inject its daily summary straight into this site for Owner visibility.
