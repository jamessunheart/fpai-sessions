# Storefront Legacy Assets

This directory mirrors the historical pages that previously lived under `/var/www/html/`:

- `products.html` – "Full Potential AI Empire" sales letter (bundle grid, pricing tiers $97–$497, testimonials).
- `get-matched.html` – AI-powered Matching Service intake form that routed prospects to operators within 24 hours.

Mission M005 should treat these as canonical references. When Droplet #15 rebuilds the storefront, pull content from here, transform it into components, then publish the compiled site to `frontend/`.
