NEW LIFE COMMUNITY CHURCH
ARTICLES OF FAITH

I. Scripture
1. We believe the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, inerrant, and infallible Word of God, and is the supreme and final authority in faith and life.

II. God
2. We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and have the same attributes and perfections.

III. Salvation
3. We believe that all people are sinners by nature and by choice, and are therefore under condemnation. We believe that those who repent of their sins and trust in Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior are regenerated by the Holy Spirit and become the children of God.
4. We believe that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful humanity.
5. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice, and that all who believe in Him are justified on the ground of His shed blood.
6. We believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of our Lord, in His ascension into Heaven, and in His present life there for us as High Priest and Advocate.

IV. Church
7. We believe that the Church, which is the body and bride of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of all true believers in Jesus Christ, and that it is the responsibility of all believers to assemble themselves together for worship, instruction, fellowship, and service.

V. Worship
8. We believe that the true worship of God is spiritual, and that it must be expressed through faith which is centered in the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the cross and which receives the Holy Spirit as the agent of God's presence and blessing.

VI. Leadership
9. We believe that God has ordained pastors, elders, and deacons to provide spiritual leadership, oversight, and care for the local church.
