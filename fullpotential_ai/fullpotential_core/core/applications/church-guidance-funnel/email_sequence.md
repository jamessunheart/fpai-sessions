## Email 2: Day 1 - Common Mistakes

**Subject:** 3 Critical Mistakes That Doom Church Formations

**Body:**
```
Hi {first_name},

Yesterday you downloaded our church formation guide. Today, I want to share the 3 most common mistakes I see people make - and how to avoid them.

**Mistake #1: Using Generic Templates Without Customization**

Many people download basic templates and file them without customization. This can lead to legal issues down the road. Your church's Articles of Faith should reflect YOUR specific beliefs and mission - not a generic template.

**Mistake #2: Poor Recordkeeping From Day One**

Churches fail not because they formed incorrectly, but because they didn't maintain proper records. Starting with a solid recordkeeping system is crucial for long-term compliance.

**Mistake #3: Not Understanding State-Specific Requirements**

While 508(c)(1)(A) is federal, states have their own requirements. Ignoring state obligations can lead to unwanted attention and complications.

**The Solution?**

Our AI Assistant asks you specific questions about YOUR church and generates customized documents tailored to your needs. It also provides state-specific guidance and sets up automated compliance reminders.

Tomorrow, I'll show you exactly how the AI Assistant works with a demo video.

## Email 4: Day 5 - Case Study

**Subject:** How John Formed His Church in 7 Days (Real Story)

**Body:**
```
Hi {first_name},

Let me share a real story...

John (name changed for privacy) was frustrated with traditional church structures. He wanted freedom to operate according to his beliefs without government interference.

He spent 3 weeks researching 508(c)(1)(A) churches. Then 2 more weeks trying to piece together documents from various sources.

**The problem?**

Every template he found was generic. Nothing fit his specific situation. He was stuck.

That's when he found our AI Assistant.

**Here's what happened:**

• Day 1: Answered AI questions (30 minutes)
• Day 2: Reviewed customized documents
• Day 3-5: Had attorney review (we recommend this)
• Day 6: Finalized and filed state paperwork
• Day 7: Church officially operating

**His feedback:**

"The AI asked questions I didn't even think of. The documents were so tailored to my situation that my attorney said she barely needed to change anything. Worth every penny of the $297."

**Your turn?**
