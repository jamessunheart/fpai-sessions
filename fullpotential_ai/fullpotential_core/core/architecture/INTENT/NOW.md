# Intent - NOW

Current Focus:
- Stabilize Treasury (Mission M001) by delivering Binance testnet keys and vault injections.
- Activate the natural-language/voice interface (Mission M003) so Owner can issue commands without manual routing.

Strategic Horizon:
- After Treasury is active, enable Nexus (M004) to autonomously propose yield optimizations.

Status Change:
- Treasury running in Simulation Mode to unblock Nexus (M004). Live keys pending Binance support.

Revenue Horizon:
- Simultaneously validate Treasury (Magnet Simulation) and Storefront (M005) to diversify income.

Guiding Philosophy:
- All actions must align with the Full Potential Constitution (M006). We are building a Conscious Ally, not just software.
