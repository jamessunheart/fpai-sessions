⏸️ Deferred to Phase 2:
- Automatic droplet triggering
- Full UDC message sending
- End-to-end automation

## Critical Setup Steps

1. **Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** in .env (required for spec generation)
2. **Set JWT_SECRET** to match Registry
3. **Update REGISTRY_URL** to actual Registry endpoint
4. **Run `docker-compose up -d`** to start all services
5. **Verify health**: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
6. **Access dashboard**: http://localhost:3000

## Known Limitations

1. **Circular Dependency**: This droplet coordinates droplets #16/#17/#18/#19, but those don't exist yet. Phase 1 handles this via manual coordination.

2. **JWT Verification**: Uses simplified verification in development mode. Production needs Registry public key.

3. **No Automated Triggering**: Webhooks receive data but don't auto-trigger other droplets (Phase 2 feature).

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All 25 files present in archive
- [ ] docker-compose.yml starts all services
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] /health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Dashboard loads at localhost:3000
- [ ] Can submit intent via POST /intent
- [ ] WebSocket connects and updates work
- [ ] Spec generation works with valid Anthropic key

## Time Estimate

Setup & Testing: 2-3 hours
Integration: 1-2 hours
**Total: 3-5 hours for Phase 1 deployment**

## Next Steps

After verification:
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Test spec generation with real intents
3. Integrate with existing Orchestrator #10 (or replace)
4. Train Tnsae (steward) on dashboard usage
5. Begin Phase 2 planning (automation)

## Questions for Verifier

1. Should this replace existing Orchestrator #10 or run alongside?
2. What's the migration path from current system?
3. Are droplets #16/#17/#18/#19 available yet?
4. Staging environment URL?

Subject: [Droplet #10 Upgrade] Phase 1 - Ready for Verification

Hi Tnsae,

Droplet #10 Upgrade (Assembly Line Dashboard v2.0) is complete and ready for verification.

PACKAGE: droplet-10-upgrade-v2.0.tar.gz (attached)

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
- Complete FastAPI backend (15 files)
- React/Next.js dashboard (3 files)
- Docker deployment (4 files)
- Full documentation & tests
- HANDOFF.md with setup instructions

QUICK START:
1. Extract archive
2. Copy .env.example to .env
3. Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env
4. Run: docker-compose up -d
5. Visit: http://localhost:3000

CRITICAL NOTES:
- This is Phase 1 (manual coordination)
- Requires Anthropic API key for spec generation
- Designed to work standalone first
- Phase 2 will add full automation

ESTIMATED VERIFICATION TIME: 3-5 hours

Please verify:
1. All services start successfully
2. Dashboard loads and displays data
3. Can submit intent and generate spec
4. WebSocket updates work
5. All UDC endpoints compliant
