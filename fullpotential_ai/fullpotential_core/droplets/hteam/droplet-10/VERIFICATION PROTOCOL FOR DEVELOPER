Files are complete. Ready to package and deliver to Tnsae for deployment! 🚀

The user uploaded a file. Let me read it to see what they want me to do with it.
💎 FOR HUMAN: READING UPLOADED FILE

Checking what's in drop10-ext.txt...

Ah! The user uploaded a file that contains the previous conversation/output that got cut off. They're asking me to continue from where it left off. Looking at the file, it appears to contain the generation I was doing, but it got truncated around line 1859 (in the middle of the frontend code generation).

The last complete section was the frontend Dashboard UI component, and it looks like I need to continue with:

    The remaining files that weren't included
    Specifically, I should provide the missing pieces and create a complete package

Let me continue from where the previous response got cut off. Looking at what's missing:

    Missing init.py files for Python packages
    Missing .gitignore
    Missing the complete test suite
    Missing some configuration details

Let me provide the missing critical files to make this a complete, working package.
