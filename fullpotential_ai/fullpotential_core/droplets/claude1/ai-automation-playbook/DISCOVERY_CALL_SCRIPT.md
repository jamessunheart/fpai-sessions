**Set the tone and agenda:**

"Hi [Name], thanks for making time. I'm James from Full Potential AI.

Before we dive in, quick check - do you still have 30 minutes? Great.

**Here's what I thought we'd cover:**

2. Show you what AI automation could look like for you (10 min)
3. Calculate your specific ROI (5 min)
4. Discuss next steps if it makes sense (5 min)

Sound good? Cool. And feel free to interrupt with questions anytime.

**Quick question to start:** What made you interested in exploring AI automation right now?"

---

## Discovery Questions (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand pain, quantify cost, identify workflows

### Current State

"Tell me about your operations. What functions are most manual right now?"

**Listen for:**
- Customer support
- Data entry
- Report generation
- Lead qualification
- Administrative tasks

**Follow-up:** "How many people work on [that function]?"

---

### Pain Points

"What's the biggest operational challenge you're facing?"

**Listen for:**
- Can't scale fast enough
- High labor costs
- Inconsistent quality
- Coverage gaps (nights/weekends)
- Bottlenecks

**Follow-up:** "What's that costing you? Time? Revenue? Opportunities?"

---

### Current Approach

"How are you handling [workflow] today?"

**Listen for:**
- Manual processes
- Multiple tools
- Handoffs between people
- Waiting on availability

**Follow-up:** "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"

---

### Budget Reality

"What are you spending on [function] now? Rough numbers - salary, tools, overhead?"

**Calculate:**
- Number of FTEs
- Average salary
- Benefits (assume 30% if they don't know)
- Total annual cost

**Follow-up:** "And how many hours per week is this function operating?"

---

### Decision Process

"If we find a solution that works, what's your process for making this happen?"

**Listen for:**
- Budget availability
- Decision makers
- Timeline constraints
- Approval process

**Follow-up:** "Is there anyone else who should be part of this conversation?"

---

## Solution Presentation (10 minutes)

**Transition:**

"Okay, based on what you've shared, here's what I'm thinking could work for you..."

---

### The Concept

"Instead of hiring another [role], what if you deployed AI agents that work 24/7 on [specific workflows]?

**Here's how it works:**
- We build custom AI agents trained on your processes
- They integrate with your existing tools ([mention tools they use])
- They handle [specific tasks mentioned]
- You get real-time dashboards showing what they're doing

It's like having an employee that never sleeps, never takes breaks, and costs 70% less."

---

### Show Example

**Share screen - show:**
- Landing page (https://fullpotential.com/ai)
- Scroll to pricing
- Show ROI calculator

"This is what it looks like in practice. Let me show you the packages..."

---

### Package Recommendation

**Based on their needs:**

**If 1 workflow, smaller team:**
"For you, I'd recommend starting with **AI Employee** - $3,000/month.
- 1 agent focused on [specific workflow]
- 24/7 operation
- Weekly reports
- Email support

This is perfect for testing the concept with low risk."

**If multiple workflows, growing team:**
"For you, **AI Team** makes sense - $7,000/month.
- 3 coordinated agents
- Handle [workflow 1], [workflow 2], and [workflow 3]
- Custom integrations with [their tools]
- Daily monitoring
- Priority support

This is our most popular package - gives you real automation power."

**If large operation, multiple departments:**
"You'd benefit from **AI Department** - $15,000/month.
- 5+ agents with full orchestration
- Automate entire [department/function]
- Unlimited integrations
- Dedicated success manager
- White-glove support

This is for companies ready to replace entire functions with AI."

## ROI Calculation (5 minutes)

**Get specific:**

"Let's run your numbers:

**Current approach:**
- [X] people at $[Y] each = $[Z]/year
- Plus benefits (30%) = $[A]/year
- Total: $[B]/year
- Availability: [C] hours/year (typically 2,000 per person)

**AI approach:**
- AI [Package] at $[D]/month = $[E]/year
- Availability: 8,760 hours/year (24/7)
- **Savings: $[B-E]/year**
- **Extra capacity: [F]x more hours**

Plus you eliminate:
- Recruitment costs
- Training time
- Turnover risk
- Management overhead

And you get:
- Instant scaling
- Consistent quality
- Real-time reporting
- Continuous improvement

Make sense?"

---

## Objection Handling

**Common objections and responses:**

---

### "That's expensive"

"I hear you. Let me reframe:

You're currently spending $[X]/year on this function, getting [Y] hours.

AI costs $[Z]/year, gives you [4Y] hours.

You're not spending more - you're spending less per hour of work.

**Plus:** First month is 50% off. So $[package_price/2] to test. If it doesn't deliver value, cancel.

Worst case: You're out $[X] but you learned something.
Best case: You just found a way to save $[Y]/year forever."

---

### "We're not ready"

"What would make you ready?

Because here's the thing - most companies say they'll automate when they have more resources. But automation gives you resources.

**Alternative:** Start with just one workflow. AI Employee at $3k/month. Prove it works. Then expand.

You don't have to eat the whole elephant at once."

---

### "We need to think about it"

"Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about?

- Budget availability?
- Technical feasibility?
- Team buy-in?
- Something else?

Because I can address those questions right now. And if it's truly not the right time, that's okay - but I want to make sure it's not just uncertainty holding you back."

---

### "How do I know it'll work?"

"Great question. Three ways:

1. **Proven technology** - Built on I PROACTIVE platform, already operational
2. **Pilot program** - 50% off first month, cancel anytime. Test risk-free.
3. **Clear metrics** - You'll see exactly what's being automated and the results

The risk is almost entirely on us. If we can't deliver value in month 1, you walk away having lost $[X]. If we can, you just unlocked $[Y]/year in savings.

What's the real downside here?"

---
