Reasoning: [Thread explaining the AI logic]

Would YOU hire these coaches? 👇
```

**Why it works:** Interactive + transparent + educational + social proof

## 🎯 Guerrilla Marketing Tactics

### 6. Strategic Reddit Commenting
**Concept:** Find posts where people are asking for recommendations, provide value

**Process:**
- Monitor these subreddits daily:
  - r/Entrepreneur
  - r/smallbusiness
  - r/Christianity (church formation)
  - r/startups
  - r/Coaches
- When someone asks "How do I find a..."
- Provide thoughtful answer FIRST
- Then mention: "I actually built a tool for this"
- NOT spammy, genuinely helpful

**Example Comment:**
```
Finding the right executive coach is tough. Here's what worked for me:

1. Define your specific goals (not just "get better at leadership")
2. Look for coaches with YOUR industry experience
3. Check if their communication style matches yours
4. Budget realistic - good coaches are $5K-15K+

I actually built an AI that automates this matching process (analyzing 5 compatibility factors). Happy to share if useful - not trying to sell, just built it because I spent 20+ hours on this last year.
```

**Why it works:** Value first, soft sell, helpful tone

---

### 7. "Fail Fast Friday" Series
**Concept:** Share every mistake and iteration publicly

- Ask for advice
- Show vulnerability
- Document improvements

**Why it works:** Authentic + relatable + builds community

**Platform:** Twitter threads, LinkedIn posts

---

### 8. "Provider Showcase" Content Engine
**Concept:** Feature each provider with compelling story

**Execution:**

- Share their methodology
- Include: "Work with Sarah through AI matching: [link]"
- One provider per week

**Distribution:**
- LinkedIn articles
- Medium posts
- Provider shares to their network
- Cross-promotion

**Why it works:** Content marketing + social proof + provider incentive to share

---

### 9. "Challenge My AI" Campaign
**Concept:** Let people test if they can out-match the AI

**Execution:**
- Post customer needs anonymously
- "Can you find 3 better matches than our AI?"
- Show AI's matches after people comment
- If someone finds better → they win free matching
- Creates engagement, demonstrates AI value

**Platform:** Twitter, LinkedIn

## 🎪 Attention-Grabbing Tactics

### 13. Controversial Take Thread
**Concept:** Strong opinions that generate discussion

**Examples:**
```
Hot take: Spending 30+ hours researching service providers is a waste of time.

Your time is worth $100-500/hour. That's $3,000-15,000 in opportunity cost.

Just pay an AI $0 to do it in 24 hours.

Thread on why "doing your research" is actually expensive 👇
```

```
Unpopular opinion: Most "AI tools" are just contact forms with ChatGPT bolted on.

Real AI should:
- Make actual decisions
- Eliminate busywork
- Replace hours of manual research

Our AI analyzes 5 compatibility factors to find your perfect provider match.

Most "AI" can't do this.
```

**Why it works:** Controversy drives engagement, positions expertise

---

### 14. "Before AI vs After AI" Comparison
**Concept:** Visual comparison of finding service provider

**Format:**
```
BEFORE AI (Finding Executive Coach):
❌ 20+ hours of research
❌ Read 50+ websites
❌ Still uncertain about fit
❌ Generic search results
❌ Analysis paralysis
Cost: $2,000+ in time

AFTER AI (Our Matching System):
✅ 2-minute form
✅ AI analyzes 5 factors
✅ 3 perfect matches
✅ 24-hour turnaround
✅ Free consultation with each
Cost: $0

Try it: https://fullpotential.com/get-matched
```

**Format:** Image carousel, video, infographic
**Platform:** Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter

### 15. "Live Match Demo" Video
**Concept:** Screen recording of actual matching process

**Content:**

- Narrate the logic
- 60-90 second video
- Add captions for sound-off viewing

**Distribution:**
- Twitter native video
