## Template 1: Initial Outreach (Cold)

**Subject:** Cut operational costs 70% with AI automation

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] is [specific observation about their business/industry]. I'm reaching out because we help companies like yours reduce operational costs by 70% through AI automation.

**Quick question:** Are you currently spending $50k-$150k/year on roles that do repetitive work like:
- Customer support ticket triage
- Data entry and validation
- Report generation
- Lead qualification

We deploy autonomous AI agents that work 24/7 for $3k-$15k/month - typically paying for themselves in the first month.

**Real numbers for a team your size:**
- Traditional employee: ~$93k/year for 2,000 hours
- AI Team (3 agents): $84k/year for 8,760 hours (4.4x more capacity)
- **Net savings: $9k+ annually + 4x productivity**

Would a 15-minute call this week make sense to explore if this could work for [Company]?

Best,
James
Full Potential AI

P.S. - We're offering 50% off the first month for pilot customers. Happy to share case studies.

## Template 3: Value-First (Warm/Referral)

**Subject:** [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Contact] mentioned you're exploring ways to scale [Company]'s operations without proportionally scaling headcount. That's exactly what we help with.

**Quick background:**
We build and deploy autonomous AI agents that automate repetitive workflows. Think: an AI employee that works 24/7 for a fraction of the cost.

**Recent example:**
We helped a [similar industry] company automate their customer support triage - went from needing 3 full-time hires ($180k/year) to 1 AI Team package ($84k/year). Same coverage, better consistency, 24/7 availability.

**I'd love to:**
1. Learn about your specific operational challenges
2. Show you what AI automation looks like in practice
3. Calculate potential ROI for [Company]

15-30 minutes this week? I can work around your schedule.

## Template 8: Objection Handling - Too Expensive

**Subject:** Re: Pricing question

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I get it - $[Amount]/month feels like a big commitment.

Let me reframe the numbers:

**Your current approach:**
- Hiring someone: $60k salary + $20k benefits = $80k/year
- Time to hire: 3-6 months
- Hours available: 2,000/year
- **Cost per hour: $40**

**AI Team approach:**
- Annual cost: $84k/year
- Time to deploy: 1-2 weeks
- Hours available: 8,760/year (24/7)
- **Cost per hour: $9.59**

You're not paying more - you're paying less for 4x more capacity.

**Plus:**
- No recruitment costs
- No training time
- No turnover risk
- No benefits/overhead
- Scale instantly

**Start small:**
Try AI Employee at $3k/month - automate just one workflow. Prove the ROI. Then scale.

**Pilot program:**
First month at 50% off = $1,500 to test. If it doesn't deliver $1,500+ in value, cancel.

Risk/reward here is heavily in your favor.

Worth a shot?

## Template 9: Objection Handling - Not Ready

**Subject:** Re: Timing question

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Totally understand - timing has to be right.

**Quick question though:** What needs to happen before you'd be ready?

Because here's what I'm hearing from most companies:

"We'll automate once we have more resources"

But the catch-22 is: automation gives you resources. Waiting until you "have time" means you never get time.

**Alternative approach:**
1. Start tiny: One agent, one workflow
2. Pilot for one month (50% off = $1,500)
3. If it works: You just freed up capacity to do more
4. If it doesn't: You're out $1,500 but you learned something

**Most common regret I hear:**
"I wish we'd started this 6 months ago"

Because once it's working, it's working 24/7. Every day you wait is a day of manual work you can't get back.

What if we scheduled implementation for [2 weeks from now]? That gives you time to prep, but commits you to actually trying it.

Thoughts?

## Template 10: Re-engagement (Cold)

**Subject:** Still struggling with [specific pain point]?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I reached out a few [weeks/months] ago about AI automation for [Company].

You were [dealing with X, considering Y, evaluating Z] at the time.

Quick update: We've now helped [X] companies in [industry] automate [specific workflows], with an average ROI of [Y]% in the first 90 days.

**New this month:**
- [Any new feature/capability]
- [Any new case study]
- Expanded pilot program (50% off first month)

If [original pain point] is still an issue, might be worth another look.

15 minutes?
