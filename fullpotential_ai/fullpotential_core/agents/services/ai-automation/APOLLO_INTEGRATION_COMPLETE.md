## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Test Fast
- Import 25-50 prospects
- Test messaging
- Iterate before scaling

### 2. Verify Email Quality

- Apollo has 95%+ accuracy
- But always use email verification service

### 3. Respect Credit Limits
- Free tier: 60 credits/month
- Basic plan: 12,000 credits/month
- 1 credit = 1 email reveal
- Search results are FREE (no credits)

### 4. Layer Multiple Filters
- Don't just filter by title
- Add company size + industry + location
- More specific = better fit = higher conversion

### 5. Save Your Best Searches
- Document what works
- Create ICP templates
- Reuse winning combinations
