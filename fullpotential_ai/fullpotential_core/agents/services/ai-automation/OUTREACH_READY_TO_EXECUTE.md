## Personalized Email Template (Example for Prospect #1)

**Subject:** Cut pet customer support costs 70% with AI

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] has been scaling fast in the premium pet space. Congrats on the growth!

Quick question: Are you currently spending $50k-$100k/year on customer support reps doing repetitive work like:
- Ticket triage ("where's my order?")
- Order status updates
- Returns processing
- Basic product questions

We help e-commerce companies like yours reduce support costs by 70% through AI automation.

**Real numbers for a company your size:**
- Traditional support team: 3 reps @ $60k = $180k/year for 6,000 hours
- AI Team package: $84k/year for 8,760 hours (24/7 coverage)
- **Net savings: $96k/year + better customer experience**

Our AI agents handle tier-1 support 24/7, freeing your team for complex issues that need human touch.

Would a 15-minute call this week make sense to explore if this could work for [Company]?

Best,
James

Hi [First Name] - I help e-commerce companies reduce customer support costs through AI automation. We deploy AI agents that work 24/7 for a fraction of the cost of hiring. Just saved one pet brand $96k/year on support alone.

## Scripts for Common Scenarios

### If they reply "Send me more info":
"Happy to! Rather than overwhelm you with docs, would 15 minutes work to discuss your specific situation? I can show you exactly how AI automation could work for [Company] and calculate your ROI. Here's my calendar: [link]"

### If they reply "Not interested":
"No problem! Mind if I ask - is it timing, budget, or just not the right fit? Always helpful to understand. Either way, appreciate the response."

### If they reply "How much does it cost?":
"Packages range from $3k-$15k/month depending on scope. For a company your size, I'd probably recommend the AI Team at $7k/month - typically saves companies $80-100k/year vs hiring. Want to hop on a quick call so I can give you a specific recommendation?"
