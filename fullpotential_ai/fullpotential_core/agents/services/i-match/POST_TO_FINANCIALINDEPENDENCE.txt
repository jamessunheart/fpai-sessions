TITLE:
Free AI matching to find financial advisor who gets FIRE

BODY:
Finding a financial advisor who understands FIRE is hard.

Most push expensive products or don't get the early retirement mindset.

I built an AI that matches you with advisors based on:
• FIRE specialization
• Fee-only requirement
• Tax optimization focus
• Your specific situation (income, savings rate, timeline)

Free service (advisors pay if you engage). Testing with 50 people.
