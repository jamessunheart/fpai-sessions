## TITLE (Copy this):

Fee-Only vs Commission-Based vs Fee-Based Advisors: What's the Difference? (And Why It Matters)

---

## CONTENT (Copy this):

Most people don't know there are 3 different compensation models for financial advisors. This can cost you tens of thousands of dollars.

Here's the breakdown:

**1. FEE-ONLY ADVISORS**

How they're paid:
- You pay them directly (hourly, flat fee, or % of assets)
- They earn NOTHING from selling you products

Pros:
- No conflicts of interest
- Fiduciary duty (legally required to act in YOUR best interest)
- Transparent pricing

Cons:
- Can be expensive upfront
- You pay even if you don't implement advice

Best for:
- People with significant assets ($100K+)
- Complex financial situations
- Those who want unbiased advice

**2. COMMISSION-BASED ADVISORS**

How they're paid:
- They earn commissions from products they sell you
- "Free" advice upfront

Pros:
- No out-of-pocket fees
- Accessible to people with smaller accounts

Cons:
- Major conflict of interest (they profit from selling you things)
- NOT required to act in your best interest (only "suitable")
- Hidden costs (commissions baked into products)

Best for:
- Simple situations (basic insurance needs)
- People who can't afford fee-only advice

**3. FEE-BASED ADVISORS** (Confusingly named!)

How they're paid:
- BOTH fees AND commissions
- Hybrid model

Pros:
- Flexibility in pricing
- Can be good value for some situations

Cons:
- Still has conflicts of interest
- Less transparent than fee-only
- Can be confusing to understand costs

Best for:
- People who want ongoing advice but also need products

**MY RECOMMENDATION:**

For most people: Start with fee-only advisors. Yes, you pay upfront, but you get unbiased advice that often saves you way more than it costs.

**Real Example:**
- Fee-only advisor: $3,000 annual fee
- Commission-based advisor: "Free" but puts you in high-fee funds
- High fees cost you: $8,000/year in hidden costs
- Net savings with fee-only: $5,000/year

**How to Find Fee-Only Advisors:**
1. Search NAPFA (National Association of Personal Financial Advisors)
2. Use XY Planning Network (for younger professionals)
3. Ask directly: "Are you fee-only or fee-based?" (Don't let them blur the line)

If you want help finding advisors who match your specific needs (fee-only, fee-based, whatever fits), I built a platform that does exactly that. Happy to share.

What type of advisor do you work with? Any horror stories or success stories?
