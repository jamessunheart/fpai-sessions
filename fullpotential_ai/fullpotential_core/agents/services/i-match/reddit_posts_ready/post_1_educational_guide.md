## TITLE (Copy this):

The 5 Questions You MUST Ask Before Hiring a Financial Advisor

---

## CONTENT (Copy this):

After helping hundreds of people find financial advisors, I've learned that most people ask the wrong questions during interviews.

Here are the 5 critical questions that will save you thousands:

1. **"How are you compensated?"**
   - Fee-only advisors work for YOU
   - Commission-based advisors may have conflicts of interest
   - Ask for full transparency

2. **"What's your fiduciary status?"**
   - Fiduciaries are legally required to put YOUR interests first
   - Non-fiduciaries only need to recommend "suitable" products
   - This is HUGE

3. **"What's your investment philosophy?"**
   - Active vs passive management
   - Risk tolerance alignment
   - Make sure it matches YOUR goals

4. **"What services do you provide beyond investments?"**
   - Tax planning, estate planning, insurance review?
   - Comprehensive planning = more value
   - Specialists vs generalists

5. **"How do you measure success?"**
   - Should align with YOUR definition of success
   - Not just "beat the market"
   - Financial goals, life goals, peace of mind

**BONUS TIP:** Interview at least 3 advisors before choosing. The right fit matters more than fancy credentials.
