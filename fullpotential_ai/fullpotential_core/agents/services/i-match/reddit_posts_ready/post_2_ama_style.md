I Built an AI Platform That Matches People with Financial Advisors - AMA

## CONTENT (Copy this):

Hey r/FinancialPlanning,

I'm James, founder of I MATCH - an AI-powered platform that connects people with financial advisors based on their specific needs, goals, and preferences.

The idea came from watching friends struggle to find advisors who actually fit their situation. Most people either:
- Pick the first advisor they meet (dangerous)
- Spend weeks researching and still feel unsure
- Give up and don't get help at all

So I built an AI matching system that:
- Asks you about your goals, budget, and preferences
- Analyzes your needs using AI
- Connects you with 3 best-fit advisors from our vetted network
- You interview them and choose the best fit

**Some interesting insights from building this:**

1. Most people don't know the difference between fee-only and commission-based advisors
2. "Best advisor" is highly personal - what works for one person doesn't work for another
3. AI is surprisingly good at matching based on communication style, not just credentials

**Ask me anything about:**
- Finding the right financial advisor
- How AI matching works
- What makes a good advisor-client relationship
- The financial services industry
- Building AI products for finance

I'm here to provide value and answer questions honestly. Not here to sell - just want to help people make better financial decisions.

What's your biggest challenge in finding or working with financial advisors?
