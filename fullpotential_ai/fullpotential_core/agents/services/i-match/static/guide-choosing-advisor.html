            Honest guide from someone whose dad is a CFP and built an AI matching system
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> I built an AI system to match people to financial advisors (you can try it at <a href="/" style="color: #667eea;">I MATCH</a>). My dad is a Certified Financial Planner. This gives me a unique perspective on what actually matters when choosing an advisor.</p>

            <p>Most guides tell you to check credentials and fees. That's important, but it's not the whole picture. Here are the questions <em>most people never ask</em> but should:</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>1. "How do you handle it when we disagree on investment strategy?"</h3>
                <p><strong>What you're really asking:</strong> Are you my advisor or my boss?</p>
                <div class="why">
                    <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Good advisors guide, they don't dictate. You need someone who respects your risk tolerance and values, even when they disagree. If an advisor can't articulate how they handle disagreement, that's a red flag.
                </div>
                <p><strong>What to listen for:</strong> They should describe a collaborative process. "We'd discuss why we see it differently, I'd share my concerns, but ultimately it's your money." Run from anyone who says "I know best."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>2. "What's the worst financial mistake you've ever made—personally or professionally?"</h3>
                <p><strong>What you're really asking:</strong> Are you human? Can you admit mistakes?</p>
                <div class="why">
                    <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Financial markets are unpredictable. You need an advisor who learns from mistakes, not one who pretends to be infallible. Their answer tells you about their honesty and self-awareness.
                </div>
                <p><strong>What to listen for:</strong> Specific story, what they learned, how they changed their approach. Be skeptical of "I've never made a mistake" or vague non-answers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>3. "Can you explain your investment philosophy in one sentence—without jargon?"</h3>
                <p><strong>What you're really asking:</strong> Do you actually understand what you're doing, or are you just following a script?</p>
                <div class="why">
                    <strong>Why this matters:</strong> If someone can't explain their approach simply, they either don't understand it deeply or they're hiding something. You need clarity, not complexity.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Examples of good answers:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 25px; color: #555;">
                    <li>"I focus on low-cost index funds and long-term discipline."</li>
                    <li>"I balance growth and preservation based on your timeline."</li>
                    <li>"I prioritize tax efficiency and risk management."</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Red flag answer:</strong> Anything that sounds like a sales pitch or uses lots of industry buzzwords.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>4. "How will you communicate with me when markets drop 30%?"</h3>
                <p><strong>What you're really asking:</strong> Will you be there when I'm panicking?</p>
                <div class="why">
                    <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Market downturns WILL happen. Your advisor's job is partly emotional support during those times. You need to know they won't disappear or panic alongside you.
                </div>
                <p><strong>What to listen for:</strong> Proactive communication plan. "I'll reach out before you call me, we'll review your goals, remind you why we built your portfolio this way." Look for someone who has a clear crisis communication strategy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>5. "What would make you fire me as a client?"</h3>
                <p><strong>What you're really asking:</strong> What are your boundaries?</p>
                <div class="why">
                    <strong>Why this matters:</strong> This reveals their values and what they expect from you. Good advisors have boundaries. If they say "nothing," they're either lying or desperate.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Examples of reasonable answers:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 25px; color: #555;">
                    <li>"If you consistently ignore my advice and then blame me for results."</li>
                    <li>"If you're not honest with me about your financial situation."</li>
                    <li>"If our working relationship becomes contentious rather than collaborative."</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The Meta-Question: Compatibility</h2>
            <p>Here's what I learned building the AI matching system: <strong>Credentials matter, but compatibility matters more.</strong></p>

            <p>Two advisors can have identical credentials, similar fees, comparable performance—but one might be perfect for you and the other terrible. Why? Communication style, risk philosophy, values alignment.</p>

            <p><strong>The real question is:</strong> Does this person think about money the way you do? Do they get what you're trying to accomplish? Can you talk openly with them?</p>

            <div class="cta-box">

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; color: #666;">
                    I built an AI system that analyzes compatibility—not just credentials.<br>
                    <span style="font-size: 14px;">Totally experimental. Free to try. Might work, might not.</span>

            </div>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>Don't just Google "financial advisor near me" and pick the first result. Don't just look at credentials and fees. <strong>Ask these questions.</strong> Listen to how they answer. Trust your gut about compatibility.</p>

            <p>The best advisor for your friend might be terrible for you. That's not a bug—it's a feature. You're looking for someone who matches <em>your</em> values, <em>your</em> communication style, <em>your</em> approach to risk.</p>

            <p><strong>Bonus question:</strong> "Why did you become a financial advisor?" If they don't light up when answering this, keep looking.</p>
