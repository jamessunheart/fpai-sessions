TITLE:
Built an AI to find your perfect financial advisor (free for customers)

BODY:
I got burned by a generic financial advisor who didn't understand tech compensation.

So I built an AI matching system that analyzes 100+ advisors to find the perfect fit based on:
• Your specific needs (RSUs, ISOs, tax optimization, etc.)
• Values alignment (fee-only vs commission, philosophy) 
• Communication style
• Specialization

Free for customers. Advisors pay us only if you engage.

Testing with 50 people this week. Comment or DM if interested.
