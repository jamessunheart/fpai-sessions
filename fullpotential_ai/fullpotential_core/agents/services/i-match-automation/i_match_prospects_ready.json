        "message": "Hi Stephanie,\n\nThanks for connecting! I'm really impressed by your focus on student loan and debt management \u2013 helping professionals eliminate $50M+ in debt is incredible impact. That specialty is exactly why I wanted to reach out.\n\nI'm James, and I've built I MATCH, an AI platform that connects financial advisors with clients who actually need their specific expertise. Instead of cold outreach or generic leads, our system matches you with people actively seeking help with student loans and debt \u2013 your sweet spot.\n\nHere's what makes it different: we only charge a 20% success fee when a client actually signs with you. No upfront costs, no wasted time on poor fits. The AI analyzes both advisor specialties and client needs to ensure quality matches, not just quantity.\n\nWe're launching with 10 select advisors in SF this week, and given your debt management focus, I think you'd be a great fit. The early cohort will help us refine the matching algorithms while getting priority access to incoming clients.\n\nWould you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to see if it makes sense? You can also check out more details here: http://198.54.123.234:8401/providers.html\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nJames",

        "message": "Hi Brian,\n\nThanks for connecting! I noticed your background as a former nonprofit CFO \u2013 that hands-on experience must give you incredible insight when advising foundations and nonprofits on their financial strategy. It's a niche that really needs advisors who understand both sides.\n\nI wanted to follow up on why I reached out about I MATCH. We're using AI to connect financial advisors with pre-qualified clients who actually match their specialty. Instead of chasing generic leads, you'd get prospects specifically looking for nonprofit and foundation planning expertise \u2013 people who already value what you bring to the table.\n\nHere's what makes it different: we only charge a 20% success fee when you actually close a client (no upfront costs), and our matching algorithm considers investment style, communication preferences, and service needs to ensure quality fit, not just quantity.\n\nWe're launching this week with just 10 advisors in the SF area to refine the platform before scaling, and I think your nonprofit specialization would be perfect for our initial group.\n\nWould you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to see if it's a fit? You can also check out more details here: http://198.54.123.234:8401/providers.html\n\nEither way, looking forward to staying connected.\n\nBest,\nJames",
