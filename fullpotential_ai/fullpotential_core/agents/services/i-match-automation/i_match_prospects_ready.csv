Sarah Chen,Senior Financial Advisor,Bay Area Wealth Management,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=Sarah%20Chen%20Bay Area Wealth Management,Hi Sarah - Building AI that matches retirement planning advisors with qualified tech exec leads in SF. Thought you might be interested in better-fit prospects?,159,"Hi Sarah,

Thanks for connecting! I noticed you specialize in retirement planning for tech executives – with 15+ years in the Bay Area market, you must have incredible insights into the unique challenges that demographic faces with their equity comp and early retirement goals.

I'm reaching out because we're launching I MATCH this week with 10 carefully selected SF advisors. We use AI to connect clients with advisors based on actual fit – their specific needs, values, and financial situation matched to your exact expertise and approach.

What makes us different: we only charge a 20% success fee when you actually close a client. No upfront costs, no subscription fees. Our AI vetting means you're only spending time with prospects who are genuinely aligned with what you do best – retirement planning for tech executives in your case.

We're intentionally keeping this first cohort small to ensure quality and give our founding advisors the best experience. Given your specialty and track record, I think you'd be a perfect fit.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to see if it makes sense? You can also check out more details here: http://198.54.123.234:8401/providers.html

Either way, looking forward to staying connected.

Michael Rodriguez,Financial Planner,Golden Gate Financial,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=Michael%20Rodriguez%20Golden Gate Financial,Hi Michael - Building AI matching for advisors in tax-efficient wealth strategies. Helping SF planners connect with pre-qualified prospects. Worth a quick chat?,160,"Hey Michael,

Thanks for connecting! I saw you made the leap from tech CFO to advising executives—that's exactly the kind of real-world experience clients are looking for, especially in tax-efficient wealth strategies.

I'm reaching out because we're launching I MATCH this week with 10 select SF advisors. It's an AI platform that matches financial advisors with clients based on specialty fit, not just ZIP codes. Think of it as quality over quantity—clients who actually need your specific expertise in executive compensation and tax strategies.

What makes this different: our AI evaluates client situations and matches them with advisors who've solved similar problems. For you, that means executives dealing with stock options, equity comp, and complex tax situations. We only charge a 20% success fee when you close a client, so there's zero upfront risk.

Since you're working with a niche clientele (former tech executives), having an intelligent matching system could save you tons of qualification time while bringing in better-fit prospects.

I'd love to show you how it works—takes about 15 minutes. Here's more info on the advisor side: http://198.54.123.234:8401/providers.html

Would you be open to a quick call this week to see if it's a fit?

Helping SF advisors connect with pre-qualified clients. Worth a quick chat?,159,"Hi Jennifer,

Thanks for connecting! I noticed your specialty in equity compensation planning – that's such a valuable niche, especially here in SF where so many professionals are trying to optimize their RSUs and stock options but don't know where to start.

I'm reaching out because we're launching I MATCH this week with 10 San Francisco advisors, and your expertise in equity comp seemed like a perfect fit for what we're building.

Quick context: I MATCH uses AI to connect advisors with clients who actually need their specific expertise – no more generic leads. Instead of the typical 40-50% referral fees, we only charge 20% success fee when a client actually engages. The AI matching means higher conversion rates because you're only talking to prospects who have the exact financial situations you specialize in (RSUs, stock options, etc.).

We're intentionally keeping this launch small to ensure quality, and I thought your equity compensation focus would resonate really well with the tech professionals in our pipeline.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to walk through how it works? You can also check out more details here: http://198.54.123.234:8401/providers.html

The model is simple: 20% success fee only when you close a client. No upfront costs, no monthly subscriptions. Our AI handles the matching quality, so you're spending time with prospects who are already a good fit for your practice.
