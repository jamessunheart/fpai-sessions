Title: Show HN: Testing if AI can match financial advisors better than Google

Text:
I built an AI matching system to test if Claude can understand compatibility well enough to match people with financial advisors.

Background: My dad's a CFP. Generic lead-gen services send him terrible matches. Meanwhile clients struggle to find advisors who get their specific situation (tech RSUs, early retirement, etc).

The experiment:
- Customer describes needs via form
- AI analyzes 100+ advisor profiles
- Matches based on specialization + values + communication style
- Free for customers (advisors pay only if they engage)

Current status:
- Zero customers (literally just launched)
- Infrastructure works
- Genuinely don't know if AI matching is better than Google

Testing: http://198.54.123.234:8401

(Yes it's an IP - testing matching before polishing domain)

What I want to learn:
1. Can AI judge compatibility well enough?
2. Will people trust AI for something this important?
3. Is this actually useful or just noise?

Honest feedback welcome. Will report back in 30 days with results.

Tech: Claude API, FastAPI, SQLite, simple matching algorithm based on needs analysis.
