## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes. White Rock Ministry operates as a 508(c)(1)(A) Private Membership Association, which is a constitutionally protected structure. All guidance provided is for educational purposes within the private membership context.

**Q: What returns can I expect?**
A: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Our treasury strategies target 20-30% APY through professional DeFi deployment, but all investment carries risk. We provide tools and education - you make the final decisions.

**Q: How is this different from financial advisory?**
A: We don't provide financial advice. We provide educational guidance and tools within a private membership association. You maintain full control and decision-making authority over your assets.

**Q: What's the time commitment?**
A: Initial setup requires 90-120 minutes for consultation plus time to implement recommended structures. Ongoing management is minimal - quarterly reviews for Premium/Platinum members.

**Q: Can I cancel or get a refund?**
A: Membership fees are non-refundable as they cover immediate access to guidance, documentation, and tools. However, ongoing management fees (Platinum) can be discontinued at any time.
