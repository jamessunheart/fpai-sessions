**2. Tech Stack (Your Choice):**

- **Medium:** Low-code (Bubble.io OR Glide)
- **Advanced:** Code (React + Firebase OR Next.js + Supabase)

**3. Features Needed:**
- ✅ Task list with filters (Available/Claimed/Done)
- ✅ Apprentice profiles (name, tier, earnings)
- ✅ Claim task button (updates status)
- ✅ Submit work form (upload files or paste links)
- ✅ Payment tracking (shows what you've earned)
- ✅ Tier badges (Bronze/Silver/Gold)

**4. Data to Track:**

- ID, Title, Description, Payment, Status, Claimed By, Due Date

Apprentices:
- Name, Email, Tier, Tasks Completed, Total Earned

Submissions:
- Task ID, Apprentice, Files/Links, Status (Pending/Approved/Revision)
```

**Deliverables:**
- Live URL (e.g., apprentice-portal.fullpotential.com or similar)
