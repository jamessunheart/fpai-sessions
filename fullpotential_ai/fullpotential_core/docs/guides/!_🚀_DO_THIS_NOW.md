I'm testing whether AI (Claude specifically) can match people to financial advisors better than just Googling "financial advisor near me".

**Completely honest about the experiment:**
- This is Phase 1 testing - very early
- I built an AI matching engine (Python + FastAPI)
- It analyzes compatibility: values, communication style, specialties
- If you're looking for a financial advisor AND willing to try an experimental AI matching system, you can help test this

**The deal:**
- Free for you (always)
- I make a small commission if you hire someone (standard 15-20% referral)
- You get an AI-analyzed match instead of random Google results
- I collect feedback to improve the system

**Currently testing with:**
- Financial advisors (this post)
- Later: Therapists, career coaches, tutors, trainers

If this works, it could scale to any service where "fit" matters more than price.

*Note: I'm one person with ~$373K to turn into $5T over 10 years (ambitious goal). This is service #1. Built with Claude AI. Being maximally honest about the experiment because that's the only sustainable way to build.*

**Questions I expect:**
1. "How does AI know compatibility?" → It analyzes what you value + what advisors specialize in
2. "Why would I trust this?" → You shouldn't yet! That's why it's an experiment
3. "What if the match sucks?" → Tell me, I'll fix it. That's the point of Phase 1

Feedback welcome. Roast it, question it, or try it.
