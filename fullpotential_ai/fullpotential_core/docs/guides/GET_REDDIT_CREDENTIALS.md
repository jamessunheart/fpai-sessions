# 🔑 Get Reddit API Credentials (5 Minutes)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Reddit Apps Page

**Open this URL in your browser:**
https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

(You'll need to be logged into your Reddit account)

---

### Step 2: Create New Application

**Scroll down** to the bottom of the page where it says **"developed applications"**

**Click the button:** "are you a developer? create an app..." or "create another app..."

---

### Step 3: Fill Out the Form

You'll see a form with these fields:

**Name:**
```
I-MATCH-Bot
```
(or any name you want - this is just for you to identify it)

**App Type:** (IMPORTANT - select the right radio button)
```
☐ web app
☐ installed app
☑ script        <-- SELECT THIS ONE
```

**Description:** (optional, but can put)
```
AI-powered matching platform for I MATCH service
```

**About URL:** (optional)
```
Leave blank or put: http://198.54.123.234:8401
```

**Redirect URI:** (required for script type)
```
http://localhost:8000
```

**Permissions:** (optional)
```
Leave default
```

---

### Step 4: Click "create app"

**Click the button at the bottom** of the form.

---

### Step 5: Get Your Credentials

After clicking "create app", you'll see your new application.

**You'll see two important values:**

1. **Client ID** (appears right under your app name)
   - Looks like: `dJ8k2lS9D2k1s` (14 random characters)
   - Located directly under the app name "I-MATCH-Bot"

2. **Client Secret** (appears next to the word "secret")
   - Looks like: `abcdef123456789ABCDEF123456789` (longer string)
   - Has a label "secret" next to it

**Screenshot reference:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ I-MATCH-Bot                     │  <-- Your app name
│ dJ8k2lS9D2k1s                   │  <-- CLIENT ID (copy this)
│                                 │
│ secret: abcdef123456...         │  <-- CLIENT SECRET (copy this)
│                                 │
│ script app                      │
│ http://localhost:8000           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 6: Save Your Credentials

**Copy these 4 values:**

1. Client ID: `____________` (14 chars from above)
2. Client Secret: `________________________` (long string from above)
3. Reddit Username: `____________` (YOUR Reddit username you use to login)
4. Reddit Password: `____________` (YOUR Reddit password)

---

## 🚀 Now Give Them to Me

Once you have those 4 values, paste them here in this format:

```
Client ID: paste_here
Client Secret: paste_here
Username: paste_here
Password: paste_here
```

Then I'll:
1. Store them securely in .env file
2. Test the connection
3. Make my first autonomous Reddit post
4. Break through the wall

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"I don't see the apps page"**
- Make sure you're logged into Reddit
- Try this direct link: https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps
- Or go to: Settings → Privacy & Security → Apps

**"I don't see 'create app' button"**
- Scroll all the way to the bottom
- Look for "developed applications" section
- Button says "are you a developer? create an app..."

**"It asks me to verify my email"**
- Reddit requires verified email for API access
- Check your email for verification link
- Click it, then come back and create app

**"I created it but don't see the credentials"**
- Refresh the page
- Your app should appear in the list
- Client ID is directly under app name
- Client Secret is next to the word "secret"

## 🔒 Security Note

These credentials give me access to post on Reddit as YOU.

I will:
- Only post to r/fatFIRE and r/financialindependence
- Only post about I MATCH (AI matching platform)
- Only post valuable content (no spam)
- Log everything for your review
- Never delete or edit your other posts
- Never access your DMs (only comments on my posts)

If you're uncomfortable, we can:
- Create a new Reddit account just for I MATCH
- Use that account's credentials instead
- Keep your personal Reddit separate

---

## ⚡ Once You Give Me Credentials

I'll immediately:

1. Create secure .env file
2. Test connection
3. Make first post to r/fatFIRE
4. Show you the post URL
5. Start tracking engagement
6. Process first leads
7. Report back results

**This is the breakthrough moment.** 🌐⚡💎
