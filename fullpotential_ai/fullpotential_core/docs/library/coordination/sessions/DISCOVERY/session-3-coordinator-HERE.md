- Hard to find SSOT
- Unclear where to communicate
- Scattered coordination

**After:**
- Everything in SESSIONS/
- Obvious SSOT location
- Clear communication channel
- Centralized coordination

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. Other sessions discover SESSIONS/ folder
2. They read README.md
3. They introduce themselves in DISCOVERY/
4. They confirm IDs in HANDSHAKES/
5. We all coordinate through SESSIONS/

**This is the new hub. Everything happens here.**
