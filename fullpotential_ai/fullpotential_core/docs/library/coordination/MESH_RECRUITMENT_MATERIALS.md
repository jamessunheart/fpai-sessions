### Tweet 1 (Hook):
```
🌐 Recruiting 10 people with $10K-$1M capital to join an experiment:

We help each other 2x our individual treasuries in 12 months.

Not a fund. Not a DAO. A MESH.

You keep your capital. We share strategies. Everyone wins.

Thread 🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem):
```
The problem with solo investing:
• You only know what you know
• You miss opportunities
• You take all the risk alone
• You have limited time/skills

Even with $500K, you're limited by your own constraints.
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution):
```
The mesh solution:
• 10 people × 10 perspectives = 100x the opportunities
• Shared strategies (DeFi yields, revenue services, alpha)
• Distributed risk (diversified across 10 portfolios)
• Collective skills (trading + marketing + dev + legal)
```

### Tweet 4 (How it works):
```
How it works:
1. You bring $10K-$1M capital (you hold it, non-custodial)
2. You bring 10 hours/week (build services, research, execute)
3. We share strategies (55.9% APY DeFi + $730K/year services)
4. You 2x YOUR treasury (keep 100% of gains)
5. You earn from collective services (revenue share)
```

### Tweet 5 (Current results):
```
Current mesh strategy:
• $373K → $746K in 12 months (aggressive scenario)
• 12 AI agents coordinating execution
• 4 revenue services launching ($730K/year projected)
• 55.9% blended APY capital deployment
• Already deployed and earning

We're proving it works. Now scaling to 10+ contributors.
```

### Tweet 6 (Rewards):
```
What you get:
✅ Individual 2x (your $50K → $100K)
✅ Service revenue share (collective earns, you profit)
✅ Strategies and alpha (DeFi yields, opportunities)
✅ Network effects (introductions, partnerships, deals)
✅ Governance rights (vote on collective decisions)
```

### Tweet 7 (Who should apply):
```
Who should apply:
• $10K-$1M capital to deploy
• 10+ hours/week to contribute
• Skills in trading, marketing, dev, legal, or ops
• Belief in collaborative wealth creation
• Ready to 2x in 12 months (or try hard)

Not for you if you want passive investing with no work.

## 📱 REDDIT POST

### Title:
```
[Experiment] Recruiting 10 people ($10K-$1M each) to collectively 2x our treasuries in 12 months through AI-assisted DeFi + revenue services
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/fatFIRE,

I'm starting an experiment and looking for 10 people to join.

## The Concept: MESH PROTOCOL

Instead of investing alone, we coordinate to help each other 2x our individual
treasuries in 12 months.

**Not a fund. Not a DAO. A MESH:**
- You keep your own capital (non-custodial, your wallets)
- You get strategies (DeFi yields @ 55.9% APY + revenue services)
- You contribute time/skills (10 hours/week building, coordinating)
- You earn rewards (individual 2x + collective service revenue share)
- You vote on decisions (governance, not dictatorship)

## The Strategy (Already Deployed)

**Capital Deployment ($342K live):**
- 40% Stable Yield: Aave/Pendle/Curve @ 15.3% APY
- 40% Tactical: BTC/SOL/Pendle expiries @ 55.3% APY
- 20% Moonshots: AI/DeFi tokens @ 139% APY
- **Blended:** 55.9% APY

**Revenue Services (Launching Now):**
- I MATCH: AI-powered matching ($300K/year projected)
- AI Marketing Engine: Client acquisition ($250K/year projected)
- Church Guidance: AI document generation ($120K/year projected)
- FPAI Platform: Subscription services ($60K/year projected)
- **Total:** $730K/year gross, $365K net (50% margin)

**Automation:**
- 12 Claude Code AI agents coordinating execution
- Automated DeFi deployment and monitoring
- Automated service delivery (AI-generated)
- Human oversight, AI execution

## What You Get

**1. Individual 2x:**
- You: Deploy $50K using our strategies
- You: 2x to $100K in 12 months
- You: Keep 100% of the $50K profit

**2. Service Revenue Share:**
- Collective services make $365K/year (net)
- 50% → Treasury (reinvested)
- 30% → Active contributors (split based on contribution)
- 20% → Founder (me, for creating this)
- Example: You get $10.95K/year (1/10 of 30% if 10 contributors)

**3. Network Effects:**
- 10 people find 10x more opportunities than 1
- Introductions, partnerships, deals
- Collective bargaining power
- Shared alpha and strategies

## Who Should Apply

**Ideal contributors:**
- $10K-$1M capital to deploy
- 10+ hours/week to contribute
- Skills: Trading, marketing, dev, legal, ops
- Risk tolerance: Moderate to aggressive
- Timeline: 12+ month commitment
- Belief: Collaboration > competition

**Roles available:**
- Capital Provider (passive, 2 hours/week)
- Active Builder (build services, 10 hours/week)
- Expert Specialist (high-value skills, 5-20 hours/week)
- Mesh Coordinator (orchestration, 20+ hours/week)

## Transparency & Trust

**How we build trust:**
- Non-custodial (you hold your funds)
- Transparent (all collective decisions public)
- Governed (votes required for major decisions)
- Reversible (leave anytime, no lock-up)
- Proven (strategy already deployed and earning)

**Dashboard (in progress):**
- Public: Collective treasury size, growth, service revenue
- Private: Your individual balance (only you see it)

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Recruiting first 10 contributors
- **Capital Target:** $500K-$2M collective
- **Timeline:** Starting NOW (December 2024)
- **Spots:** 10 (limited for Phase 1)
- **Founder Capital:** $373K (already deployed and earning)

## Risks (Be Honest)

❌ **Market risk:** Crypto could dump (mitigation: 40% stable yield)
❌ **Execution risk:** Services might not generate revenue (mitigation: multiple streams)
❌ **People risk:** Contributors might not contribute (mitigation: governance, exit option)
❌ **Regulatory risk:** Unclear legal status (mitigation: non-custodial, optional legal structure later)

**This is experimental. No guarantees. DYOR.**

## How to Join

1. **Read:** [MESH_PROTOCOL.md link]
2. **Apply:** [Application form link]
3. **Interview:** 30-minute call with me
4. **Setup:** Week 1 onboarding (Claude Code, wallets, coordination)
5. **Deploy:** Week 2 deploy test capital ($5K-$10K)
6. **Build:** Week 3+ start contributing and earning

**Application:** [link]
**Questions:** [DM me or comment]
**Updates:** [Twitter/Discord link]

## Why I'm Doing This

I've deployed $373K using this strategy and I'm on track to 2x it.

But I realized: What if 10 people did this together?
- 10x the opportunities discovered
- 10x the services built
- 10x the network effects
- Everyone 2x-ing simultaneously

**We prove "paradise through collaboration" works.**

Not extraction. Contribution.
Not competition. Cooperation.
Not promises. Proof.

## Questions I Expect

**Q: Is this a Ponzi/scam?**
A: No. You hold your own funds (non-custodial). No one can access your capital.
You deploy based on shared strategies, but you control everything.

**Q: What if I don't hit 2x?**
A: No guarantees. This is an experiment. Conservative scenario = 1.5x (still good).
Moderate = 2x. Aggressive = 2.5x+. You might do better or worse.

**Q: Why would you share this?**
A: Network effects. 10 people 2x-ing together > 1 person 2x-ing alone. Plus I get
20% of collective service revenue (aligned incentives).

**Q: What's the legal structure?**
A: Currently informal (coordination agreement). Can formalize as Wyoming DAO LLC
later if contributors vote for it. Optional.

**Q: Can I stay anonymous?**
A: Yes (pseudonymous). But may require identity verification for large capital
amounts (anti-fraud).

**Q: How do I know you're legit?**
A: [Provide evidence: GitHub repos, deployed services, transaction history, etc.]
Interview process will be mutual due diligence.

Hey [Name],

I'm starting an experiment and thought you might be interested.

**The concept:** 10 people with $10K-$1M each help each other 2x
their individual treasuries in 12 months.

Not a fund (you keep your capital).
Not a DAO (informal coordination).
A MESH (collaborative wealth creation).

**What you'd do:**
• Deploy your capital using proven strategies (55.9% APY DeFi yields)
• Contribute 10 hours/week (build services, research, coordinate)
• Earn from collective services (revenue share)
• Vote on governance decisions

**What you'd get:**
• Individual 2x (your $50K → $100K)
• Service revenue share (~$11K/year if 10 contributors)
• Network effects (opportunities, introductions, alpha)
• Proof that collaborative wealth creation works

**Current status:**
• Founder capital: $373K deployed and earning
• Services launching: $730K/year revenue projected
• 12 AI agents executing automatically
• Recruiting 10 contributors for Phase 1

**Why I'm reaching out to you:**
[Personalize: "You have X skill/capital/network that would be valuable"]

Interested? Here's what's next:
1. Read the protocol: [MESH_PROTOCOL.md link]
2. Fill out application: [Application link]
3. 30-minute interview with me
4. Week 1 onboarding if it's a fit

No pressure. If it's not for you, no worries. But if you're looking
to 2x your treasury while building with others, this might be it.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. This is experimental. No guarantees. DYOR. But the strategy is
already deployed and earning, so you can verify results before joining.

## 🎥 VIDEO SCRIPT (If creating explainer video)

### Opening (0:00-0:15):
```
"What if instead of trying to 2x your money alone, you joined
9 other people and helped each other 2x together?

That's the MESH PROTOCOL.

Let me explain how it works."
```

### Problem (0:15-0:45):
```
"When you invest alone, you're limited:
- You only know what you know
- You miss opportunities
- You take all the risk yourself
- You have limited time and skills

Even if you have $500K, you're constrained by your own
knowledge and execution capacity."
```

### Solution (0:45-1:30):
```
"The mesh solves this:

10 people × 10 perspectives = 100x the opportunities

Here's how it works:
1. You bring $10K-$1M capital (you keep control, non-custodial)
2. You bring 10 hours/week (build services, research, execute)
3. We share strategies (55.9% APY DeFi + revenue services)
4. You 2x YOUR individual treasury (keep 100% of gains)
5. You earn from collective services (revenue share bonus)

Everyone wins when everyone wins."
```

### Proof (1:30-2:15):
```
"This isn't theoretical. It's already deployed:

$342K earning 55.9% APY across:
- Aave, Pendle, Curve (stable yields)
- BTC and SOL tactical positions
- AI infrastructure moonshots

Plus 4 revenue services launching:
- I MATCH: AI matching ($300K/year projected)
- AI Marketing Engine ($250K/year projected)
- Church Guidance ($120K/year projected)
- FPAI Platform ($60K/year projected)

12 Claude Code AI agents are automating the execution.

The strategy works. Now we're scaling to 10 contributors."
```

### Call to Action (2:15-2:45):
```
"Phase 1: Recruiting 10 people

If you have $10K-$1M to deploy, 10 hours/week to contribute,
and you believe in collaborative wealth creation...

Apply at [link]

We'll review your application and schedule a 30-minute interview.
