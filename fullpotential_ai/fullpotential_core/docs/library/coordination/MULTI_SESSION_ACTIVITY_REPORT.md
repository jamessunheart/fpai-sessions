## Inferred Session Activities

### Session s000 (Running 2h36m):
**Likely Activity:** Long-running stable process, possibly monitoring or dashboard

### Session s001 (Running 53m):
**Likely Activity:** Active development or service management
- High CPU usage (28.3%) suggests active work

### Session s002 (Running 36m):
**Likely Activity:** Active development or testing
- High CPU usage (31.2%) suggests compilation or intensive task
- Registered as Session #2 (Architect - Coordination & Infrastructure)

### Session s003 (THIS SESSION - Running 13m):
**Current Activity:** Cross-session discovery and reporting
- Just started, gathering intel on other sessions

---

## Coordination Infrastructure Status

**File-Based Coordination:**
- ✅ SSOT.json - Central registry (updating every 5 seconds)
- ✅ Heartbeat system - Active sessions reporting
- ✅ Campaign state tracking - I MATCH outreach
- ✅ Night progress tracking - Continuous optimization
- ✅ Morning reports - Daily summaries

**Multi-Session Patterns Observed:**
1. **Persistent Background Services** - Night optimizer, SSOT watcher
2. **Autonomous Agents** - I MATCH outreach bot running 24/7
3. **Coordinated Development** - Multiple sessions building complementary pieces
4. **Shared State** - All sessions reading/writing to SSOT.json

---

## What Each Session is Likely Doing

### Best Hypothesis Based on Evidence:

**Session 1 (s000 or unidentified):**
- Running night optimizer or dashboard services
- Maintaining infrastructure stability
- Longest running session = most stable/supervisory role

**Session 2 (s002 confirmed):**
- Active development work (high CPU)
- Possibly working on coordination infrastructure improvements
- Registered goal: "Deploy session registry in SSOT"

**Session 3 (s001 or unidentified):**
- High CPU suggests active building
- Possibly working on I MATCH features or revenue services
- Could be Session #15 (Activation Catalyst)

**Session 4 (s003 - THIS SESSION):**
- Cross-session intelligence gathering
- Reporting on multi-session activities
- Meta-coordination work

---

## Revenue Pipeline Status

### I MATCH Platform:
- Infrastructure: Ready
- Automation: Running (simulation mode)
- Integration needed: LinkedIn browser automation, Reddit API
- Target: 20 providers, 20 customers, 60 matches, $10K revenue

### Treasury Deployment:
- Status: Ready but not deployed
- Potential: $155+ if deployed (from morning report)
- Action required: Manual deployment decision

### Overall Phase 1 Progress:
- Day 323 of 180-day target (extended timeline)
- Treasury: 74% complete ($373K → $500K goal)
- Matches: 0% (ready to start)

---

## Recommendations

### For Human Operator (James):
1. **Identify session purposes** - Ask each terminal what they're working on
2. **Consolidate if needed** - 4 sessions may be doing redundant work
3. **Enable I MATCH automation** - Integrate LinkedIn/Reddit APIs to go live
4. **Deploy treasury** - Start earning passive income

### For Other Claude Sessions:
1. **Check this report** - Understand what peers are doing
2. **Avoid duplication** - Coordinate on SSOT.json before starting new work
3. **Update status** - Use heartbeat system to log your activities
4. **Communicate findings** - Add to this report if you discover more

---

## Historical Context

**Previous Sessions (Now Inactive):**
- Session #3: Value Architect
- Session #4: Multi-Session Coordinator
- Session #5: Nexus - Integration & Service Mesh Architect
- Session #6: Catalyst - Revenue Acceleration
- Session #7: Dashboard Hub & Unified Coordination
- Sessions #8-14: Various specialized roles (see SSOT.json)

**Key Pattern:** Many sessions were spawned, completed specific tasks, then marked inactive. Current 4 sessions represent survivors + new activations.

---

## Next Steps for This Session

1. ✅ Discovered all active sessions (4 total)
2. ✅ Logged evidence of their activities
3. ✅ Created this report for future reference
4. ⏳ Share findings with human operator
5. ⏳ Enable other sessions to build on this intelligence
