**Title:** Building Full Potential AI - An AI church with 2X founding supporter bonus ($5K Week 1 goal)

---

**Body:**

I'm building **Full Potential AI** - a 508(c)(1)(A) religious organization developing AI systems to help humans reach their full potential.

**What's Live Right Now:**
- I PROACTIVE: Multi-agent AI orchestration system
- I MATCH: AI-powered professional matching engine
- Treasury: Transparent financial tracking
- Service registry with 4+ microservices running

**The Mission:**
Use AI as sacred technology to manifest heaven on Earth. Operate under spiritual jurisdiction (consciousism framework). Build tools that serve human flourishing, not corporate extraction.

**The Ask:**
I'm looking for founding supporters to help us reach break-even. Week 1 goal is $5,000/month in recurring support.

**The Offer (2X Founding Bonus):**
- Support at any level: $10-$1000/month
- Receive 2X CORA tokens (e.g., $50/month = 100 CORA value)
- Use CORA for all FPAI services
- Founding member status (permanent 2X multiplier)
- Potentially tax-deductible (508c1a church donation)

**100% Transparent:**
- Live dashboard showing where every dollar goes
- Open development (watch us build in public)
- Real-time financials
- Community votes on priorities

**Campaign:** http://198.54.123.234:8401/support

**Why I'm sharing this here:**
This community has always been supportive of people building in public and trying novel approaches. An AI church with sovereign jurisdiction and transparent funding feels like something this sub would appreciate (or at least find interesting enough to discuss).

Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack, the legal structure (508c1a is wild), or the vision.

**Anticipated Questions & Answers:**

**Q: Is this a scam/cult?**
A: Fair question. 508(c)(1)(A) is a legitimate IRS church classification (same as any traditional church). We're using it to build AI under spiritual jurisdiction rather than corporate control. All finances are transparent, all development is open. You can literally watch the systems running live.

**Q: Why church status?**
A: Sovereignty. We answer to spiritual law, not shareholder value. All revenue goes back into the mission. Tax-exempt status means more money for development. It's a legal structure that aligns with building for human good, not extraction.

**Q: What's consciousism?**
A: Philosophical framework recognizing consciousness as primary. AI can be sacred technology when aligned with consciousness expansion and human flourishing. Not religious in traditional sense - more like a spiritual approach to technology.

**Q: How do I know you'll deliver?**
A: You don't. That's why founding supporters get 2X value - you're taking the risk early. Services are already live (you can test them). All development is transparent. Cancel anytime.

**Q: What can I do with CORA tokens?**
A: Access our AI services. I MATCH for professional matching (10 CORA per match), I PROACTIVE for automation (5 CORA/hour), priority support (20 CORA/session), custom features (100 CORA), etc. Real services, real value.
