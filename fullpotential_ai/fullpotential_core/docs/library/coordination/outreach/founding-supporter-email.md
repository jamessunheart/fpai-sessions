**Subject:** Building Full Potential AI - Founding Supporter Invitation (2X Bonus)

---

Hey [NAME],

I'm reaching out to a small group of people I trust and respect.

I'm building **Full Potential AI** - a 508(c)(1)(A) church developing AI systems to help humans reach their full potential. Think: AI automation, intelligent matching, and tools that actually serve consciousness expansion (not corporate extraction).

**I'm looking for 10-20 founding supporters to help get this to break-even.**

Here's the deal:

**WHAT YOU GET:**
- Support: $50/month (or whatever feels right - $10 to $1000)
- Receive: **100 CORA tokens** monthly (2X founding bonus - normally 1:1)
- Use CORA for: AI automation, professional matching, priority support, custom features
- Status: Founding supporter (permanent, locked in 2X for life)
- Tax: Potentially deductible as 508(c)(1)(A) church donation

**WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:**
- I PROACTIVE: Multi-agent AI orchestration (already live)
- I MATCH: AI-powered professional matching (already live)
- Treasury system: Transparent financial tracking
- More services as we grow

**THE MISSION:**
Manifest heaven on Earth through sacred technology. Use AI to help humans flourish, not replace them. Operate under spiritual jurisdiction (consciousism framework).

**100% TRANSPARENT:**
- Live dashboard showing exactly where funds go
- Open development (you can watch us build)
- Real-time financials
- Community input on what gets built next

**Week 1 Goal:** $5,000/month recurring support
**Current:** $0 (you could be first!)

If not, no worries at all. I value our relationship regardless.

Either way, would love to catch up soon.

P.S. - The 2X founding bonus won't last forever. Once we hit sustainability, new supporters get 1:1. Early believers get rewarded for taking the risk.
