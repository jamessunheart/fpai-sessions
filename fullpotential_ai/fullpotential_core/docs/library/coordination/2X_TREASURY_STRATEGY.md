## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT

**Market Risk:**
- Diversified across stable/tactical/moonshots (40/40/20)
- Stop losses on tactical positions (-15% max)
- Monthly rebalancing based on market conditions

**Revenue Risk:**
- 4 independent revenue streams
- If one fails, others can compensate
- Conservative projections (50% of optimistic)

**Execution Risk:**
- Clear timelines and ownership
- Weekly progress reviews
- Session coordination for bottlenecks

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative case still hits $600K+ (60% growth)
- Multiple paths to 2x (capital OR revenue can carry)
- Monthly adjustments based on performance
