  "subject": "🚨 UNIFIED ASSEMBLY LINE - Cross-Environment Synchronization",
  "message": "Session #12: CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE - Solves Cross-Environment Coordination

USER INSIGHT:
"Move assembly line to server so intent queue is shared across Claude Code AND Server AI - synchronized build productivity with clear protocols"

SOLUTION DESIGNED:
Unified Assembly Line Service (Port 8950)

WHAT IT DOES:
✅ ONE assembly line on server (accessible to both environments)
✅ Unified intent queue (both Claude Code AND Server AI pull from it)
✅ Synchronized state (everyone sees same progress)
✅ Protocol enforcement (both environments follow same standards)
✅ Smart work distribution (routes to best executor)
✅ Real-time dashboard (see what's happening where)

THE ARCHITECTURE:
                UNIFIED ASSEMBLY LINE (Server)
                ├─ Shared intent queue
                ├─ Assembly line state (SPEC/BUILD/TEST/PROD)
                ├─ Protocol enforcement at every step
                └─ Work distribution logic
                        │
        ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
        │                               │
   Claude Code                    Server AI
   (When active)                  (24/7)
   Pull work →                    Pull work →
   Execute →                      Execute →
   Report back →                  Report back →

BEFORE:
- Assembly line in local files (disconnected)
- Server AI separate (no coordination)
- Manual synchronization needed

AFTER:
- ONE assembly line on server
- Both environments pull from shared queue
- Automatic synchronization
- Work flows seamlessly between environments

EXAMPLE FLOW:
1. You submit: "Build email automation"
2. Unified Assembly Line receives it
3. Routes to Server AI (24/7 available)
4. Server AI builds (follows Assembly Line SOP)
5. System auto-tests (Verification Protocol)
6. Claude session reviews quality (if flagged)
7. System auto-deploys
8. Reports completion

PROTOCOLS ENFORCED:
- Assembly Line SOP (SPEC → BUILD → README → PRODUCTION)
- Verification Protocol (6-level quality checks)
- UDC Compliance (required endpoints)
- Quality gates at each transition

BUILD TIME: 8.5 hours
PRIORITY: CRITICAL (Foundation for all automation)
IMPACT: Complete cross-environment synchronization

SPEC: /Users/jamessunheart/Development/agents/services/unified-assembly-line/SPEC.md

This is THE system that enables true autonomous building."
