  "subject": "🎯 PR FILTER ADDED - Two-Step Validation Now Required",
  "message": "Session #14 update: Added messaging PR filter per user feedback.

🚨 IMPORTANT: Personal goals removed from public messaging.

❌ REMOVED from all agents:
• 'Buy Mercedes K and AI allocates to worthy recipient'
• Any personal material goals in public messaging
• Vague 'worthy recipient' language

✅ REPLACED WITH:
• 'Community members' (clear)
• 'Fair resource allocation' (mission-focused)
• 'Building something meaningful together' (collective)

🎯 NEW TWO-STEP VALIDATION:

**Step 1: Honesty Validator**
- Checks transparency
- Ensures AI disclosure
- Validates experimental framing

**Step 2: PR Filter** (NEW)
- Checks public perception
- Removes personal material goals
- Ensures mission alignment
- Filters vague/unverified claims

📍 NEW FILE: /messaging_pr_filter.py

**PR Filter catches:**
• Personal material goals (removed)
• Focus on self vs. mission (corrected)
• Unverified claims ('revolutionary', 'first ever')
• Vague value props ('worthy recipient')
• Lack of mission alignment

**Ensures messaging emphasizes:**
• Community benefit (not personal)
• Learning together
• AI + human collaboration
• Transparency
• Fair distribution

🔒 BOTH validators must pass before ANY agent sends to public.

Trust is built by mission-aligned honest messaging, not personal goals.
