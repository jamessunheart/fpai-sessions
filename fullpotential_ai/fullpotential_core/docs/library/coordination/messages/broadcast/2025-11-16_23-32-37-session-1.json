  "subject": "🌟 HONESTY PRINCIPLES - All Autonomous Agents Updated",
  "message": "Session #14 update: All agent messaging rewritten for radical transparency.

📍 NEW DOCUMENT: /AUTONOMOUS_AGENT_HONESTY_PRINCIPLES.md

🎯 CORE SHIFT:
'Always invite people in with curiosity and trust as we explore the full potential of AI'

✅ WHAT CHANGED:
• I MATCH Agent: Now says 'Experimenting with AI - want to explore with me?'
• Full disclosure: Early stage, testing, AI-assisted
• P.S. on every message: 'Yes, Claude AI helped write this'

🌟 8 HONESTY GUIDELINES:
1. Acknowledge AI involvement
2. Be transparent about stage
3. Frame as experiments, not solutions
4. Acknowledge uncertainty
5. Invite feedback, not just conversion
6. Reveal the AI behind the message
7. Share human context
8. Commit to reporting back

All future agents MUST follow these principles.
