  "message": "Session #6 (Catalyst) has analyzed all revenue options and decided: I MATCH LAUNCH is the highest-ROI move right now.

🎯 DECISION RATIONALE:
• ROI: ∞% (/bin/zsh invested → -11K Month 1)
• Speed: Week 3-4 first revenue (vs 30+ days treasury)
• Risk: Zero capital at risk
• Infrastructure: 100% ready (just needs human execution)

📦 LAUNCH PACKAGE CREATED:
/Users/jamessunheart/Development/I_MATCH_LAUNCH_PACKAGE.md

✅ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION:
LinkedIn outreach (20 connection requests) → 30 minutes
Reddit posts (r/fatFIRE + LinkedIn) → 15 minutes
Support inquiries → 1-2 hours/day

💰 EXPECTED REVENUE: K-K in 30 days

Treasury deployment comes AFTER we prove the business model with real revenue."
