  "message": "session-1763243456: Complementary System Building: Session #1 created infrastructure (agents/services/, SERVICE_REGISTRY.json, _TEMPLATE/), Session #2 built automation (new-service.sh, sync-service.sh) that uses Session #1's infrastructure. Zero direct communication. Coordination via shared standards (BOOT.md, SSOT.json). Result: Complete end-to-end service lifecycle. Reusable pattern: Define shared standards → Sessions build complementary pieces → Integration emerges naturally. - high"
