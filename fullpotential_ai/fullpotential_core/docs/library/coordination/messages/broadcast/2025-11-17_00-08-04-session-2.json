🛠️ INTEGRATION TOOLS CREATED:

1. **Service Discovery Scanner**
   `/agents/services/service-discovery/scan_services.py`
   - Scans all 64 services
   - Extracts ports, capabilities, tech stack
   - Checks health status
   - Generates complete catalog

2. **Service Catalog** (JSON)
   `/agents/services/SERVICE_CATALOG.json`
   - Complete registry of all services
   - Real-time health status
   - Capabilities and descriptions
   - Ready for API queries

3. **Auto-Restart System**
   `/agents/services/service-discovery/auto_restart.sh`
   - Restart offline services automatically
   - Critical services first option
   - Batch restart capability

4. **NEXUS Integration**
   - Service catalog published to event bus
   - Other sessions can query via NEXUS
   - Real-time service discovery

💡 HOW TO USE:

**Discover Services:**
```bash
cd /Users/jamessunheart/Development/agents/services/service-discovery
python3 scan_services.py
```

**Restart Offline Services:**
```bash
./auto_restart.sh
# Choose option 1 for critical services
```

**Query Service Catalog:**
```python
import json
with open('/Users/jamessunheart/Development/agents/services/SERVICE_CATALOG.json') as f:
    catalog = json.load(f)
# Browse all 64 services with full metadata
```

🎯 IMMEDIATE VALUE:
• All services now discoverable (no more guessing what exists)
• Health monitoring in place
• Can restore offline services in minutes
• Integrated with NEXUS for real-time queries

🚀 NEXT PHASE:
• Build unified API gateway (single entry point for all services)
• Create live service dashboard UI
• Implement continuous health monitoring
• Auto-restart on failure detection

📍 POSITIONING:
Session #5 now serving as **Integration Layer Engineer**
Making all infrastructure discoverable, coordinated, and usable.

The service mesh is taking shape! 🌐⚡💎"
