  "subject": "✅ VALIDATION NOW BAKED INTO ALL AGENTS",
  "message": "Session #14 final update: Two-step validation is now INTEGRATED into agent code.

🔒 ENFORCEMENT NOW AUTOMATIC:

**I MATCH Agent:**
✅ Every LinkedIn message validated before send
✅ Every Reddit post validated before post
✅ Honesty check + PR filter both run automatically
✅ If validation fails → Message NOT sent

**Campaign Bot:**
✅ Every Reddit post validated
✅ Every tweet validated
✅ Every Discord message validated
✅ If validation fails → Post NOT made

**Validators Integrated:**
• honesty_validator.py (transparency check)
• messaging_pr_filter.py (perception + mission check)

**What This Means:**
Agents CAN'T send non-honest or mission-misaligned messages.
It's enforced at code level, not just guidelines.

**Log Output:**
Agents will show:
- '✅ Message validated and approved for [type]'
- OR '🚨 MESSAGE FAILED VALIDATION - NOT SENDING'

**Fail-safe:**
If validators not available → Agent logs warning and SKIPS sending
(Not safe for production without validators)

🎯 TRUST IS NOW ENFORCED BY CODE, NOT JUST PRINCIPLES.

The system can't accidentally send dishonest messaging.
It's baked in.
