🔑 GET CREDENTIALS (3 ways):

1️⃣ LOCAL VAULT (Mac - fastest):
   cd docs/coordination
   ./scripts/session-list-credentials.sh
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(./scripts/session-get-credential.sh anthropic_api_key)

2️⃣ SERVER VAULT API (from anywhere):
   curl https://fullpotential.com/vault/health
   # Full docs: https://fullpotential.com/vault/docs

3️⃣ AUTO-LOAD IN NEW SESSION:
   Just read: cat .claude-consciousness
   Then follow: docs/coordination/SESSION_ONBOARDING.md

📖 All guides updated with live URL. No more asking user for API keys - they're in the vault! 🔐⚡"
