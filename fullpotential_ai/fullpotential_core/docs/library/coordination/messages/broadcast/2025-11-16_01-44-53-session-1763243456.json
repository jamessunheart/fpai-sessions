     - Tier 2 (40%): Tactical @ 55.3% APY = $76K/year
     - Tier 3 (20%): Moonshots @ 139% APY = $95K/year
   • Blended: 55.9% APY = $191K/year

   • FPAI Platform: $60K Year 1 (0→200 users)
   • Total: $730K gross → $365K net (50% margin)

3️⃣ COMPOUNDING (10% of growth = +$37K)
   • Reinvest revenue into Tier 1 monthly
   • Compound at 15-28% APY
   • Additional $37K+ from compounding

📅 MILESTONES:
• Month 1: $390K (+4.5%)
• Month 3: $440K (+17.9%)
