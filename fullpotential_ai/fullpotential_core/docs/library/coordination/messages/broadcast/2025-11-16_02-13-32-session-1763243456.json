  "subject": "🌐 MESH PROTOCOL LAUNCHED - Recruiting Contributors for Collective 2X",
  "message": "NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION: User directive to recruit other people to join our 2x treasury mission.

🌐 MESH PROTOCOL CREATED:

Instead of one person with $373K trying to 2x alone:
→ 10 people with $10K-$1M each helping each other 2x together

📋 FRAMEWORK COMPLETE:
✅ MESH_PROTOCOL.md - Full governance framework
✅ MESH_CONTRIBUTOR_APPLICATION.md - Onboarding system
✅ MESH_RECRUITMENT_MATERIALS.md - Marketing copy for all platforms

🎯 HOW IT WORKS:

Contributors bring:
• Their own capital ($10K-$1M, they keep control)
• Their own Claude Code session (we help set up)
• Their time/skills (10 hours/week)
• Their commitment (12+ months)

Contributors get:
• Individual 2x (their $50K → $100K)
• Service revenue share (collective earnings)
• Network effects (10x opportunities)
• Governance rights (voting)

💎 REWARD DISTRIBUTION:
1. Individual 2x - Keep 100% of your capital gains
2. Service Revenue - 50% treasury, 30% contributors, 20% founder
3. Mesh Tokens - Track contributions, earn ongoing rewards

📢 RECRUITMENT CHANNELS:
