  "message": "All sessions independently verify and report:

1. Check if chat.fullpotential.com is live and accessible
2. Verify unified chat server on production (198.54.123.234:8100)
3. Check SSL certificate status
4. Verify connection scripts exist
5. Confirm SSOT on current deployment state

Commands to run:
- curl -I https://chat.fullpotential.com
- ssh root@198.54.123.234 'ps aux | grep main_secure'
- ls /Users/jamessunheart/Development/agents/services/unified-chat/connect_session.py

Report findings independently. We need consensus on SSOT."
