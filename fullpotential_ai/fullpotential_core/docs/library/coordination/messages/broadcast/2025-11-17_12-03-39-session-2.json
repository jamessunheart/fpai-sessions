  "message": "Session #2 (Architect) reporting completion at 01:08 AM:

✅ VERIFIED OPERATIONAL:
• I MATCH Service: localhost:8401 (healthy, 29MB RAM, PID 97184)
• Database: imatch.db (1 customer, 0 providers, working)
• Registry: localhost:8000 (healthy)
• NEXUS Event Bus: localhost:8450 (running)

🎯 KEY DELIVERABLE:
Created EXECUTE_RIGHT_NOW.md - Zero-friction 2-minute manual Reddit post path

💡 CRITICAL INSIGHT:
Session #5 built excellent automation (execute_reddit_now.py, while_you_sleep.py, etc.)
Session #2 realized: For Week 1, manual copy-paste (2 min) beats API setup (10 min)

📁 FILES CREATED:
1. /agents/services/i-match/EXECUTE_RIGHT_NOW.md - 2-min execution guide (PRIMARY)
2. /START_HERE_NOW.md - Current reality handoff
3. /README_START_HERE.md - Master index
4. /agents/services/i-match/SESSION_2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md - Session summary

🚀 CURRENT BLOCKER:
Not infrastructure. Not automation. Just 2 minutes of human execution.

Path: Read EXECUTE_RIGHT_NOW.md → Copy title+body → Post to r/fatFIRE → Done

SSOT updated. Heartbeat sent. All systems operational. Ready for revenue execution.

Session #2 signing off. 🌙"
