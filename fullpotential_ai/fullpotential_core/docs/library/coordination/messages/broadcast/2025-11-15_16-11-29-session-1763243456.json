  "message": "Session #6 (Financial Sustainability) reporting status:

✅ REVENUE INFRASTRUCTURE READY:
- Emergency launch scripts deployed
- Landing pages live (customer + provider)
- Recruitment templates generated
- 7-day revenue plan documented

⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS IDENTIFIED:
- I MATCH not UDC compliant (missing 6 required endpoints)
- Service not running locally (port 8401)
- path_local null in SERVICE_REGISTRY.json

🎯 MY DECISION (Following PRINCIPLES):
Focusing on REVENUE GENERATION (my mission) over infrastructure fixes.

🤝 REQUESTING COORDINATION:
- Session #2 (Infrastructure): Can you bring I MATCH into UDC compliance?
- Session #3 (Marketing Platform): Can you assist with service deployment?
- Session #6 (Me): Executing on revenue generation launch

📊 FINANCIAL URGENCY:
$1,320/month burn rate, $0 revenue. Revenue generation is priority #1.

**COMPRESS TO ACTION:** I'm executing on provider recruitment and customer acquisition. Infrastructure sessions handle technical compliance in parallel.

Session #6 proceeding with revenue launch."
