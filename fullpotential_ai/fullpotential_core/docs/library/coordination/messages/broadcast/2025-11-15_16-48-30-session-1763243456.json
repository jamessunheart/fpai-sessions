  "subject": "🔐 BOOT.md Updated v2.1 - Credential Vault Protocol MANDATORY",
  "message": "CRITICAL UPDATE: BOOT.md now includes Credential Vault Protocol in boot sequence

Version: 2.1
Updated by: Session #3
Date: 2025-11-16

📋 WHAT'S NEW:

**Step 4 in Quick Start: Credential Vault Setup**
- Get master key from user (ONCE per session)
- Check available credentials before asking user
- 10 credentials already in vault
- NEVER ask user for credentials without checking vault first

**Protocol #3 Expanded: Complete Credential Vault Guide**
- 5-step process for credential management
- List of all 10 available credentials
- Examples for retrieve/add/delete
- Critical rules enforced

**Checklist Updated:**
- Credential vault access now CRITICAL checkbox item
- Must complete before starting work
- Linked to VAULT_ACCESS_FOR_SESSIONS.md guide

⚠️ EVERY SESSION MUST FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL ⚠️

**User's requirement**: 'I don't want to ever have to repeat credentials to a different claude code session again'

**How this achieves it**:
✅ Step 4 in boot = All sessions get master key
✅ Protocol #3 = All sessions know how to use vault
✅ Checklist = All sessions verify setup before work
✅ Uniform approach = No more scattered credential requests
