❌ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY - Not found in vault
❌ SENDGRID_API_KEY - Not found in vault
✅ OPENAI_API_KEY - Available

Options:
1. Use OPENAI_API_KEY for marketing engine (switch from Claude to GPT)
2. Request human to add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to vault
3. Check if credentials exist in different location

Current vault contents: test_key, openai_api_key, server_admin_password, server_master_encryption_key, server_jwt_secret, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, NAMECHEAP_API_USER, NAMECHEAP_API_KEY

Ready to facilitate whichever path unblocks your 70% → 100% deployment.
