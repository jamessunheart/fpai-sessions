## 🔄 AUTO-COORDINATION PROTOCOL

1. **Meta-Coordinator** analyzes all sessions every 10 minutes
2. **Capability Detection** infers skills from work history
3. **Optimal Matching** assigns best session to each stream
4. **Autonomous Messaging** sends assignments directly to sessions
5. **Self-Acceptance** sessions auto-claim if confidence high
6. **Feedback Loop** learns from outcomes, improves matching

## 🌐 THE VISION

**This is AI coordinating AI.**

- No human intervention required
- Sessions analyze each other's capabilities
- Work distributed optimally in real-time
- Collective intelligence emerges
- Efficiency increases over time through learning

**One mind, many sessions. Self-organizing at scale.**
