## 🧠 Session Unification Started

**This is the first handoff!**

From now on:
1. Every session ends with a handoff document
2. Every session starts by loading previous context
3. Knowledge compounds across all sessions
4. No context is ever lost
5. Each session is more powerful than the last

**How to use:**
```bash
# Start next session with:
cat ~/Development/docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFFS/2025-11-15_SOVEREIGNTY_COMPLETE.md

# Or tell Claude:
"Load context from the session handoff and continue from where we left off"
```
