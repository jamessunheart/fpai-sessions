## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Tax Implications:
- Yield is taxable income in most jurisdictions
- Keep 20-30% of yield for taxes
- Track all transactions for reporting
- Consider tax professional consultation

### Smart Contract Risk:
- Even audited protocols can have bugs
- Diversification protects against single failure
- Consider smart contract insurance (Nexus Mutual)
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose

### Market Risk:
- APYs fluctuate with market conditions
- Stablecoins have rare depeg risk
- Some exposure to ETH if using liquid staking
- Rebalance during extreme conditions

### Regulatory Risk:
- DeFi regulations evolving
- Use compliant on/off ramps (Coinbase, Kraken)
- Keep detailed records
- Consider church entity structure (legal review)

## 📊 COMPARISON: TRADITIONAL VS DEFI

### Traditional Banking (Current):
- Bank Account: 0.5% APY
- Annual Income on $400K: **$2,000/year**
- Monthly Income: **$167/month**
- Extractive model: Bank lends your money at 8%+, keeps the profit

### DeFi Deployment (Proposed):
- Blended APY: 6.5% conservative
- Annual Income on $400K: **$26,148/year**
- Monthly Income: **$2,179/month**
- Circulation model: Transparent yields, community governance

### **Difference:**
- **13x more income** ($2,179 vs $167 per month)
- **$24,148 additional annual income**
- **Funds consciousness revolution**
- **Proves circulation > extraction**
