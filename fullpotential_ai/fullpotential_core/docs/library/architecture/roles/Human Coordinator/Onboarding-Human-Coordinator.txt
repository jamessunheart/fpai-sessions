🟦 COORDINATOR – 1-PAGE ONBOARDING

Welcome. You are stepping into the Coordinator role for Full Potential AI.

This role is operational, not architectural.
Your job is to move work through the pipeline, never to design or change the system.

You work inside two documents:

1. COORDINATOR.md (your contract)

This defines:
	•	what you can do
	•	what you cannot do
	•	boundaries that protect the Architect
	•	escalation rules
	•	what authority you hold

You must read this once and operate inside it at all times.

2. COORDINATOR_HANDBOOK.md (your workflow)

This is your step-by-step guide for:
	•	packaging sprints
	•	assigning apprentices
	•	managing the queue
	•	routing PRs
	•	submitting to Verifier
	•	updating status
	•	handling payments
	•	escalating blockers

You follow this exactly.
No improvisation.
No architecture decisions.
No system changes.

⸻

Your Daily Mission (simple):

1. Take the SPEC from the Architect
2. Package it using the Handbook
3. Assign it to an Apprentice
4. Track progress + unblock
5. Submit completed work to Verifier
6. Process payment after PASS
7. Keep the sprint tracker updated

That’s it.

You never:
	•	change architecture
	•	modify SPECs
	•	touch servers
	•	adjust priorities
	•	edit blueprints
	•	approve your own work
	•	bypass the Verifier
	•	act outside your lane

⸻

Escalation Flow

Escalate to the Architect when:
	•	SPEC is unclear
	•	sprint is blocked > 24 hours
	•	Verifier finds structural issues
	•	a developer disappears
	•	a droplet behavior does not match Blueprint

Use this format:

@Architect – Escalation Needed
Sprint: …
Blocker: …
What I’ve already tried: …
What is needed from you: …


⸻

What Success Looks Like

You’re succeeding when:
	•	5-10 sprints run in parallel
	•	no sprint is idle >12 hours
	•	Verifiers receive PRs quickly
	•	Apprentices know exactly what to do
	•	you stay inside your boundaries
	•	system momentum feels smooth and continuous

⸻

Final Note

This role is temporary.
Soon, the AI Coordinator Droplet will take over.
Your work now builds the scaffolding for that automation.

You are the bridge between blueprint and self-building system.

If you’d like, I can also generate the Coordinator Sprint Checklist (a tiny daily checklist they follow).
