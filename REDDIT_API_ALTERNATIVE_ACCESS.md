## 🤔 What You Might Be Seeing

### Scenario A: You're Not Logged In
**If you see:** A login page or no "create app" button

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/login
2. Log in with your Reddit account
3. Then go back to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

**Don't have a Reddit account?**
- Go to https://www.reddit.com/register
- Create free account (takes 2 min)
- Verify email
- Then access /prefs/apps

---

### Scenario B: Account Too New
**If you see:** "Account doesn't meet requirements" or similar

**Reddit requires:**
- Email verified
- Account at least 30 days old (sometimes)
- Some karma (sometimes)

**Quick fix:**
- Verify your email if not verified
- Comment on a few posts to get karma
- Wait a bit, try again

---

### Scenario C: Wrong Page Layout
**If you see:** Different layout than expected

**Try:**
1. Use Old Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. This version always shows the developer section clearly

---

### Scenario D: "Developed Applications" Section Empty
**If you see:** The page but no "create app" button

**Look for:**
- Text that says "are you a developer? create an app..."
- Or button that says "create another app..."
- Usually at the very bottom of the page

**It looks like this on old.reddit.com:**
```
developed applications
────────────────────────────
are you a developer? create an app...

[Click that link]
```

## 🚨 If NOTHING Works

We have backup options:

### Backup Plan A: Create New Reddit Account
If your current account doesn't have access:

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/register
2. Create new account: "imatch_bot" or similar
3. Verify email
4. Go to https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps
5. Create app with new account

### Backup Plan B: Use Different Service
Instead of Reddit, we can try:

1. **Twitter/X API** - Post to crypto Twitter
2. **LinkedIn API** - Post to professional network
3. **Direct Outreach** - Email campaigns
4. **Discord Bot** - Join FIRE/wealth Discord servers

### Backup Plan C: Manual First Post
If API is blocked:

1. You manually create ONE Reddit post
2. I monitor comments via web scraping
3. I process leads automatically
4. We prove the model works
5. Then get proper API access
